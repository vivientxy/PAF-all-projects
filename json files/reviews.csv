2015-04-08T04:00:00.000Z,5461928,Gail,"Stephanie is a delightful,thoughtful and generous host. She was prompt in responding to questions and left her home in a welcoming manner. The cottage is delightful,comfortable and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay there. Glebe is just wonderful with lots of atmosphere and close to many of Sydney's highlights.This was our first foray into Airbnb and we are hooked! It was an excellent initiation and no doubt a hard act to follow!I thoroughly recommend Stephanie and her cottage and Glebe. I hope that I can stay there again."
2015-07-13T04:00:00.000Z,5461928,Claire,"Stephanie is an excellent host and her house is lovely.  It was perfectly ready for us when we arrived, Stephanie communicated well with us throughout the booking and arrival process, and her instructions for using the facilities were clear and easy to follow.The house is in a wonderful location, close to Sydney University and Glebe Point Road.  Staying there was thoroughly enjoyable as the house was in perfect order and the kitchen was well appointed.  The view out to the back garden was an added bonus."
2015-07-21T04:00:00.000Z,5461928,Paige,We had the best time & that was due to Stephanie's home & how at ease she made us feel. It was just like home away from home & Glebe is a beautiful suburb.
2015-08-24T04:00:00.000Z,5461928,Colleen,"The house was clean, beautiful and had a lot of character. Steph is warm and professional, and we had no issues with any of the amenities or access during our short stay. Highly recommend this place!"
2015-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,5461928,Roberto,"We had a great stay at Stephanie's house.A walking distance from cafes, groceries stores and other amenities came in very handy. The apartment is very well kept and very clean. It has a cozy flavour as well."
2015-12-01T05:00:00.000Z,5461928,Melissa,"Highly recommended! Stephanie was a gracious host and her home was an inner city delight. Great location within walking distance to Sydney Uni and the restaurants and bars of Glebe, her home was comfortable and well appointed. A great experience! "
2017-08-06T04:00:00.000Z,19348489,Mehrab,"We stayed in Isabelle's apartment for one month. We found Isabelle hospitable and thoughtful. Her beautiful studio was so clean and we enjoyed its amazing sunlight, great view and location (close to open spaces, CBD, cafes and restaurants). In short, this experience increased our expectations regarding a place to stay in Sydney!"
2018-01-07T05:00:00.000Z,19348489,Felix,"We love the studio. Very comfortable, clean and convenient to major tourist locations. Isabelle answers all questions promptly and is very accommodating. We highly recommend stating here."
2018-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,19348489,Felix,"Great location. Both residential and touristy with many shops around. We could walk nearly everywhere and if we were tired the train and buses are right near the house. Make sure to have coffee at La Douce France right near the house. The studio is very comfortable, sunny and fully equipped."
2018-02-10T05:00:00.000Z,19348489,Frank,Isabelle was extremely communicative throughout the entire stay. The location and space was great and I thoroughly enjoyed my time there. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking at booking.
2018-08-05T04:00:00.000Z,19348489,Шамиль,"Everything was great, I really enjoyed my stay in Sydney. Thank so much to Isabelle."
2019-01-12T05:00:00.000Z,19348489,Jonathan,"Isabelle's place is cosy and in a great location with leafy Rushcutter's Bay Park on one side and bustling King's Cross on the other. There are lots of places to eat nearby and the two major supermarkets are not too far away. It's nicely decorated, airy, the bathroom is relatively new and the internet is really quick."
2016-12-05T05:00:00.000Z,12740176,Jaron,"Great place. Perfect for families or adult groups for that matter. Great location. Across road from beach, cafe next door. Great host. Couldn't be more helpful. "
2017-01-06T05:00:00.000Z,12740176,Terry,"Hi Marissa and Damien, thanks so much for the wonderful stay.  Your home was spacious and the times we had 12 people there - it never felt crowded.  The kitchen was well equipped and swimming pool  / trampoline kept the kids entertained.The house was perfect  - we had family from Brisbane and Darwin for a very special and rare Christmas and New Year.The location was perfect, nice and close to beach, an easy walk to movies and local shopping centre.PS: The ocean views from balcony are stunning, and there is nothing better than lying in bed listening to the sounds of the ocean.Once again - thanks so much - Julie and Terry "
2018-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,12740176,Eileen,Marissa's place is lovely. I was delighted to discover that there is a sea view from the main bedroom balcony and a great coffee shop and restaurants across the road. There is lots of space and great for a big family. It is walking distance to the beach. I would recommend this house highly.
2018-12-26T05:00:00.000Z,30479760,Novita,Lower your expectation! :)
2018-12-30T05:00:00.000Z,30479760,Armin,"Contact the host and make sure the air con and other amenities listed are ACTUALLY working and EXIST as I was fooled about the aircon which was broken and he knew it but didnt inform me. Its very similar to a hotel room structure and he is not leaving in the premises, therefore be aware of likely poor communication as for my time he was overseas and couldnt get to him by phone."
2019-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,30479760,Scott,"Rooms are extremely small, the photos on the listing are a little deceiving. The place is fairly close to a few little shops. It is newly renovated and modern but overall the stay was fairly average."
2019-01-06T05:00:00.000Z,30479760,Aria,"The room itself while small was clean, the rest of the apartment was less than abismal regarding cleanliness."
2019-01-21T05:00:00.000Z,30479760,재광,정말 훌륭합니다.신축이라 시멘트가 조금 떨어지기도 하는데 아주 깔끔하고 편리한 숙소였습니다
2019-02-02T05:00:00.000Z,30479760,燕红,"交通很便利,入住体验不错!"
2019-02-25T05:00:00.000Z,30479760,Phoebe,"Perfect location and perfectly furnished, keypad was so handy rather than having a key, quick responses from ken if I ever needed help, very nice and modern would stay here again"
2019-02-26T05:00:00.000Z,30479760,Napassorn,Ken is a superhost and great communication with fast responses.
2016-12-16T05:00:00.000Z,16134812,Wendy,Great Place and Great Host!Definitely recommend staying here!10/10!
2017-11-06T05:00:00.000Z,21421463,Sue,"The location was perfect for our needs and the apartment was quiet.  The check in did not go well as we weren't told which apartment it was and the key had to be collected from another location over 1km away which we didn't know either until we got there, and had sent the uber off.  The listing says there is a key safe but they didn't use it for us.  The host wasn't contactable either despite calling the 24 hr number a couple of times and leaving messages, so the whole process took about an hour and a half.  The apartment is tiny and is more of a bedsit rather than having a separate bedroom.  This also made me wonder about the very expensive $170 cleaning fee."
2017-11-14T05:00:00.000Z,21421463,Jenny,Great apartment with walking distance to bus stops and cafes. The property is very safe with the access control system. Suitable for the girls. Nice and helpful staff.
2017-11-17T05:00:00.000Z,21421463,Danielle,Very clean and well put together apartment. Would suit a longer stay. I was on a business trip so just needed a bed. The location is amazing.  Comfy bed. Lots of additional amenities to make your stay more comfortable.
2017-11-27T05:00:00.000Z,21421463,Melissa,"The apartment was super clean and had a lot of conveniences.  There is no view to speak of but we only slept there so that wasn't such a big deal. Quiet street. Great washer/dryer for use. Good amenities. Beware of the footboard on the bed- it sticks out beyond the mattress and loves to bite your shins. The biggest headache was the check in process; we arrived a bit late and had to check in at a hotel that was kind of far away - especially when dragging our luggage uphill most of the way late at night. Also, do NOT get on the elevator - in our jet lagged state we failed to notice the lettered-wing and got on the elevator only to get stuck for 10 minutes... especially concerning as the emergency button didn't seem to work. You'll be on the first floor; door was open and unlocked when we arrived but for the rest of the visit it was locked when arrived to add to security."
2017-12-08T05:00:00.000Z,21421463,Renee,"Great comfortable little apartment for a business trip.  Full size ironing board and good quality iron was nice.  Later check in meant I had to get the keys from another location which was easy enough, just a little annoying."
2017-12-19T05:00:00.000Z,21421463,Tristan,"I really enjoyed this unit. It was probably the most functional space anyone could have created for a studio. It has everything you need and more. A workplace, living area, kitchen, washer/dryer, balcony, nice bathroom, and plenty of storage space throughout. The only downside is the unit is not equipped with AC. Fortunately they provided two fans which were very helpful and needed. Everything else was perfect and the host did an excellent job communicating and assuring I had a great stay. The location of the unit is within the Darling Harbour area and only a ten-fifteen minute walk from the Central business district. Near a park and many businesses and restaurants. Would recommend it to a couple or single person."
2017-12-29T05:00:00.000Z,21421463,Lylyan,Verything was perfect!
2018-02-10T05:00:00.000Z,21421463,Tim,"Great location, great place."
2018-02-18T05:00:00.000Z,21421463,Neal,"The apartment is fantastic and the stay was one of the easiest experiences I had in terms of check-in/out and overall communications. The surrounding area is nice with the various piers and parks. The apartment was very clean, well decorated and spacious. Would highly recommend for future visitors to the area. Only feedback I can give is that I couldn’t work out access to the gym but that may have been my failure. Other than that, the stay was excellent and responses to any messages were very fast. Thanks!"
2018-03-06T05:00:00.000Z,21421463,Kevin,Location is great. The place is well decked out and true to the advertisement. The sofa bed can use a firmer mattress but the main bed is comfortable .   Satisfied in general .
2018-03-31T04:00:00.000Z,21421463,Gilberto,"The place was clean and equipped with everything, including extra soap and towels, and even a face scrub. Facilities are great, especially the swimming pool. The only downside is that checking in requires picking up the key at a nearby hotel, which took a few minutes"
2018-08-22T04:00:00.000Z,21421463,Damon,"Great, neat flat with everything you need in a beautiful pocket of Sydney."
2018-09-03T04:00:00.000Z,21421463,Kevin,"My parents, both in their seventies, stayed in the apartment for eleven nights.  They were very satisfied and found it to be very comfortable and well furnished.  They did suggest that it would have been helpful if the equipment, e.g. washing machine and coffee machine, had simple instructions on their use.  Also, there was very little cutlery - especially a shortage of spoons.They did appreciate the surrounding quiet environment."
2018-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,21421463,Giselle,"Clean, confortable place in an outstanding location."
2018-10-14T04:00:00.000Z,21421463,Sharna,"An absolute stunning apartment, so stylish and spacey, very modern and great location, everything was very easy with checking in and out l, host was very very helpful!!"
2018-11-08T05:00:00.000Z,21421463,Gerry,"This property has a decent-sized balcony with open or closed shutters and is a terrific space for a quiet sit or a nice breakfast.  The lounge is also decent-sized and has an awesome Smart TV.The bedroom is a ‘nook’ style, behind the full-sized kitchen - which has a large, clean and effective fridge.  So privacy has to be managed, but for a couple this is not an issue.The bathroom is new, modern, roomy and has a larger cnr shower.Everything was provided from toiletries, towels, milk, bikkies, even spare batteries for the remotes.This property is 1 min walk to Star Casino, 3 mins to a full-sized Coles supermarket, 5 mins to Darling Harbour and 15 mins the the city of Sydney.  This was all walking times, not driving.I rented a car from AVIS in the casino and they let me park it for free in the casino for 3 days as well.This is a super apartment for a couple or 2 individuals.  It is very quiet - like dead quiet, but the city noise is heard when the windows and balcony doors are open.  I love that noise, but you hear nothing when they are closed.The pool is large at 30m long, but it is on the opp side of the complex."
2018-11-11T05:00:00.000Z,21421463,Kate,Great location and cute apartment. We really enjoyed our stay and would stay again.
2018-11-17T05:00:00.000Z,21421463,Michael,Very nice appartment !
2018-12-01T05:00:00.000Z,21421463,Maulik,Perfect studio apartment in Pyrmont in Sydney. A short walk from the CBD and the fish market. Very clean and comfortable. One queen/full bed and one sofa bed that sleeps two.
2018-12-21T05:00:00.000Z,21421463,Holly,perfect location for fantastic value!
2019-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,21421463,Javier,Do not book this apartment on summer season. Don’t make the same mistake I did: Note that there is NO AIR CONDITIONING and the apartment gets really warm; it is very hard to sleep. Communication with the host was impossible; still waiting for a “solution”.
2019-02-05T05:00:00.000Z,21421463,Hayley,"Thank you for such an amazing stay. We really enjoyed our time and it was everything we expected. Loved the apartment  and swimming pool was a plus. We only just realised a few days in that there was a bus stop right round the corner from us. This came in very handy. Close to the casino, close to shopping malls, close to a supermarket. Even had Netflix which made our time that much more enjoyable during our downtime. 20min walk to cbd and nearest train station. Only thing I could recommend is having a more powerful fan as we ended up sleeping with the sliding door open. I ended up getting bitten a few times. But other then that was an awesome stay. Thank you for being a lovely host."
2019-02-13T05:00:00.000Z,21421463,Jose Vicente,"Apartment was clean, well equipped and in a good location with bus stops nearby and a 8min walk to the pier."
2019-02-17T05:00:00.000Z,21421463,Angela,"Great location, perfect for the two of us and would defiantly stay there again"
2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,16126537,Candice,"Great central spot. Short walk to the fish markets, Casino and Darling Harbour. Everything is at your doorstep."
2019-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,16126537,Liz,Richard’s place was great and accomodated 7 of us very comfortably. Location is perfect near fish market darling harbour beautiful walk to the rocks and circular quay. I could live there forever. Thanks for having the pantry full with useful items and the fridge had a chocolate bar yum. I highly recommend this accommodation Liz
2019-02-17T05:00:00.000Z,16126537,Akihide,Location is good.
2015-06-09T04:00:00.000Z,6228208,Martin,The host canceled this reservation 73 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2017-06-09T04:00:00.000Z,18841207,Suzanne,It was close to the airport and very clean. Highly recommended
2017-06-20T04:00:00.000Z,18841207,Phil,A pleasant and hassle-free place to stay. Really good value.
2017-07-09T04:00:00.000Z,18841207,Yong,Very clean room and the May is veryFriendly.
2017-07-17T04:00:00.000Z,18841207,Zhuoshi,May is quite warmhearted and super nice. The room is clean and the mattress is soft which make me home over here.
2017-10-02T04:00:00.000Z,18841207,Erika,"May is a lovely person, I'll recommand her anytime! oh and, her dog daisy is adorable!"
2017-11-12T05:00:00.000Z,18841207,Joanne,"Lovely self contained place with washing machine, TV bathroom. May was very helpful and nice. Good location near restaurants. Unit was very clean. Secure place. I would stay here again."
2018-02-26T05:00:00.000Z,18841207,刘,"房间很干净,可以自己做饭｡距离火车站大约步行20分钟,还是挺方便的｡火车站有大超市｡房间内东西很全｡"
2017-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,17113625,Sylvie&Herve,"Verry good place, good bed , good explainations , we appreciated swiming and jaccuzi after whole day discoverring Sydney, more for young people , so Nice thanks we recommand this place verry cheap and good."
2017-02-14T05:00:00.000Z,17113625,Jane,The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2017-02-15T05:00:00.000Z,17113625,Garrison,"The place is not too far from Sydney CBD, about 20 minutes walk to central station and $13 one way uber ride. Bus ride to CBD was about $3.80. Air conditioning in the room does not really cool the room properly. It was more like a fan. The building and location was pretty safe. There is a GoGet Pod right in front of the building which is very convenient if you use GoGet. David, the host, was also a very nice and helpful.Overall it was a pretty good place if you're looking for a budget accomodation. Can't really complain for the price."
2017-09-17T04:00:00.000Z,17113625,Daniel,"Good location, 10 minutes walk to the closest buses. This is in a good neighborhood and we felt safe walking in the streets at night. It's close to the airport too, shops and services are all nearby.Hosts were friendly, quiet, and left us to do our own thing, which we all appreciate in a share apartment, and were very happy to help if we had any questions or needed anything. Definitely recommend and there is a host of amenities available if required. Not sure how well the air conditioner works, we used it for heating and it seemed to do the trick, even though we couldn't feel any air pressure. Shower and bathroom are both clean and good. We definitely recommend these hosts."
2017-10-20T04:00:00.000Z,19846740,Matthew,"Great place , very modern, clean , easy to communicate with the hosts , definitely worth a stay"
2017-11-03T04:00:00.000Z,19846740,Jenny,"We found this apartment to be really wonderful to stay in! The view is amazing (although not the water view shown in the photo, which must have been taken from the south side of the building). But wonderful all the same. The apartment faces north You can see a little bit of ocean in the distance ,beyond Manly I guess.  We looked forward to coming home to the apartment every day. So comfortable. It helps to pull the curtains a bit going out for the day so it doesn’t get too hot. There is a great cafe with friendly staff, and good coffee and food in the courtyard below.  It’s called Springtime. There is a bus-stop to shoot into town in about 7 minutes almost directly across the road. Lots of restaurants nearby including a very colourful Mexican one. The directions  to get in if   you are driving, need to be clearer. And it helps to know that it is on level 11  and that the attachment on the key needs to be held near a small box to make the lift go to your level. All in all a magnificent and thoroughly enjoyable stay, and really comfortable beds. "
2017-12-18T05:00:00.000Z,19846740,Mia,Great apartment I’m a great location. Was just a bit disappointed at the lack of utensils in the kitchen and also we clearly stated that we needed a 3rd mattress however although being told there was one there it wasn’t anywhere to be found. Our 4th guest had to sleep on a cot mattress for 2 nights.
2018-01-10T05:00:00.000Z,19846740,Marc,I truly recommend this place.
2018-01-29T05:00:00.000Z,19846740,Joe,"Perfect apartment in a great location and is equipped with cot, change table, high chair and toys for small children."
2018-02-26T05:00:00.000Z,19846740,Sunny,"Good location,bus stop in front of building, 5 mins walk to wolli ."
2018-03-17T04:00:00.000Z,19846740,Rachel,"Wonderful space. Very clean and comfy. Great for kids. Quiet but with amenities and restaurants all very close. Could have used a few more plates and cups, but that’s being picky. We’d absolutely stay here again and recommend it to families."
2018-04-15T04:00:00.000Z,19846740,Alex,"We enjoyed staying in Crows Nest - it's close to the main hub of the suburb and a quick walk to trains to get into the city.  Also, the memory foam mattresses were really comfortable - everyone was saying they slept really well!"
2018-04-27T04:00:00.000Z,19846740,Amin,It’s a beautiful apartment for families with kids. We truly enjoyed our stay and highly recommend this place. The communication was great and we had everything we needed. Thanks Will and Rãchël

2018-09-24T04:00:00.000Z,19846740,Hanan,Had a great stay!
2018-09-26T04:00:00.000Z,19846740,Josie,Convenient location
2018-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,19846740,David,"There are some things you will be pleased with here but the cleanliness, clutter, kitchen facilities, bedding, crockery and plates will not be what you will enjoy, I'm sorry."
2018-10-11T04:00:00.000Z,19846740,Sarah,"Great location and lovely 2 bedroom apartment.Limited storage for guests, and kitchen essentials was limited.Would stay again!!"
2018-10-13T04:00:00.000Z,19846740,Carlos,"Excellent, will definitely stay again when I am back."
2018-11-19T05:00:00.000Z,19846740,Kevin,Would be an ideal one or two night stop over. Lovely beds/sofa and toys for kids. Very little space if you wish to unpack any clothes (even if just one person) not much kitchen ware if you want to prepare meals. So I wouldn't recommend for longer stays although our family of 5 managed for a week.
2018-11-28T05:00:00.000Z,19846740,James,Will and Rachel were amazing. So helpful when we lost our car keys. We didn’t have kids but this is the best place for kids under 6.
2019-01-08T05:00:00.000Z,19846740,Bojena,"Well located but terribly run.The keys were given to me 4h late.The entire place was very dirty.Not even vacuumed.No Space for hanging or even shelf’s for personal staff ,all full of hosts things like if they were living there.Floor in the living area full of plastic toys,which were always in the way.Kitchen sticky, the walls and all.Pantry full of half started smelly ingredients.Under the sofas and the rest of furniture dust,dirt,lost items including old passport,combs etc.Dryer in the laundry with dirt from weeks and weeks.Balcon-more of the same -dirt and storage for the host .I have pictures to show.Never will I look at this place again and I would not recommend it to anyone who doesn’t like filth."
2019-01-16T05:00:00.000Z,19846740,Alice,"Hi,I’m very much aligned with Bojena feedbacks (last guest in jan)! Her comments are Not “unfair” Will and Rachel ...sorry! I confirm, This place is not well run. Maybe the location and the appartement itself are great. But cleanliness please!!!! And There is no excuse of early checkin this time....What is it then ? Anyway, as hosts you have the responsibility of providing a clean and tidy place . And your place is not! I had to clean the place for 2 hours to make it acceptable. I had to do a laundry of my sheets on arrival. The sheets were not even the right size to cover the mattress. We decide not to use the kitchen appliances as they were dirty and had to do take away and restaurant every time! The fridge was so dirty I refused to put food in it. I had to vacuum the floor....and on the top of that they didn’t had any hair dryer (the host asked me to buy one and ask for refund. Yes sure, I’m on holidays and I have to take care of the equipment of your appartement Will...).I have past experiences with Rb’nb that have been fantastic! This experience is such a disappointment in regards.... I’ll make sure to look better at the guests comments in the future.I do not recommend this appartement.Alice"

2018-08-21T04:00:00.000Z,27555785,Becky,"The apartment exceeded our expectation with its view and its modernity, its within walking distance from central station, Chinatown, 10mins walk to Pyrmont bay, and tram stop to fish market. The host replies rather quickly to any request or simply any questions. Most housing appliances were provided. Highly recommended "

The location of the place was outstanding with it only being a 10min walk to darling harbour and a 10 minute train ride into the CBD! 10/10 would recommend and stay again!

The apartment is very modern with all the necessary amenities to make you feel at home and the underground secure parking provides peace of mind. My booking enquiry was responded to within a couple of hours so we were able to book the apartment very quickly. Jared and Diana will make you feel very welcome so if you're looking for a place in and around Rouse Hill don't hesitate in booking this place it's awesome! P. S if you know how to play the piano you'll love It even more :)"
2015-05-11T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,Lisa,"Jared & Diana were wonderful hosts, were easy to communicate with, welcoming and happy to help in any way they could. The apartment is situated above a shopping precinct which was very convenient and was surprisingly very quiet! Highly recommend! "

Nicely furnished, very comfortable and fully equipped. Very clean on arrival and some really nice touches provided by the hosts.

2015-09-27T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,Jennifer,"The unit is very comfortable and nicely decorated. You could stay one night or a month in complete comfort. The bed is very comfortable but I would like to suggest there was an option of another pillow. My husband only uses one, but I need two. That is only a personal thing.  The position is fantastic, and you would never get bored.  There is every shop imaginable, cinemas and white we were staying, there was a hot rod/vintage care show on  in the main street, with live entertainment. We highly recommend the unit and its position to anyone visiting the hills district of Sydney. Jared and Diana are lovely."
2015-10-05T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,Chris,"Jared and Diana were great, they were very flexible and keen on making sure everything went well with my stay.  The apartment was perfect,  very nicely furnished and in great location.  I would definitely stay again and would recommend it to others"
2015-10-11T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,Stewart,"Diana welcomed us at the apartment, showed us how to enter and leave the complex. Garage underneath and shops also under the apartments easily accessible. Apartment was as described. We were entirely satisfied and would return .Apartment itself very clean with all facilities you would require."

2016-06-21T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,Emma,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was absolutely perfect! A huge thank you to Diana and Jared, who are were excellent hosts - communicative, thoughtful and warm.  I was made to feel incredibly comfortable in their home and I loved every bit of my stay.  Diana gave me clear instructions on how to find the place and communicated really well in the lead up to my arrival, making the transition smooth and stress free. I loved the little touches.  There were chocolates and water left out on the bed, milk and juice in the fridge and beautiful candles lit for my arrival.  I immediately felt right at home.  The unit is modern, comfortable and in a truly amazing location.  The Rouse Hill shopping precinct has every shop you would need and you literally step out the door and you are right in the thick of it.  The furnishings are modern yet comfortable, and the property is equipped with all the little things that you need for a week away (everything from laundry powder to salt & pepper shakers).  Thank you so much for your wonderful hospitality guys!"
2016-07-10T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,Yvonne,Diana was so welcoming. She added little touches like Irish teabag and milk and chocolate to mention a few. She thought of everything.  Such a fantastic host. Always at the end of the phone if you needed her. Definitely would stay again.
2016-12-13T05:00:00.000Z,5604994,Errol,"Great accommodation, clean with all you could want to make your stay pleasant, great high speed broadband, close to the shops and restaurants.  Diana met us to check us in, nice touch with some juice a a chocolate on our bed.  Secure building with nice balcony on the top floor.  You don't need more than this..."
2017-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,5604994,Eileen,"We have just had 16 nights at Jared and Diana's apartment and perhaps the best compliment we can pay is that we did not want to leave as it had become to feel like home. It is a beautiful, spacious place, very well equipped with all you need to live there like a local. Being on the top floor there are good views across the lake and you hardly know that the shops are only a few steps away from the main door. We found having all the shopping facility and restaurants so available was a real bonus.Diana communicated very well prior to arrival and was at the apartment to meet us. A delightful lady who was most friendly and welcoming. There were provisions in the fridge, chocolates on the table and a beautiful vase of flowers all helping to give the feeling of home from home. She was always available on the phone if we had any questions.The car parking space below proved very useful too.We loved Rouse Hill and when we return we will definitely be looking to stay at Jared and Diana's apartment again."
2017-04-15T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,Melissa,"Awesome place. Would definitely recommend. Lovely couple, lovely home. "

2017-04-28T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,Darryl,"I had a pleasant stay, in Jared and Diana's lovely top floor apartment. My only concern was that I couldn't stay longer !Well located and central, a great place to stay.Thanks Guys. !"
2017-05-11T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,Elliot,"The apartment is exactly as described and pictured. Check in and check out was simple and all communications were clear. The bed is very comfortable and the apartment is quiet and fully equipped with all you would need. It sits 5 floors above the shops, which means it only take a couple of minutes to get to either Coles or Woolworths and there are also a great cross section of restaurants and take aways if you don't feel like cooking. Secure car park is handy also. "
2017-05-22T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,Belinda,Jared & Diana were fantastic to deal with and accommodating with our request.  The location is central to everything you need at Rouse Hill.  A very pleasant experience.
2017-07-08T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,Sal,"The apartment was very well positioned and was very comfortable to stay in. Diana was really responsive and helped us throughout the week. I would highly recommend this apartment for anyone who is traveling near the area, thank you Diana."
2017-07-14T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,Graeme,"Thank you Jared & Diana for the warm welcome and generous hospitality. We had a wonderful week in your immaculate apartment with all the comforts of home and the added bonus of an abundance of natural light throughout each room! The location is ideal and made every aspect of our holiday a breeze from the parking of our car, to walking to all the local amenities - shops, restaurants and entertainment. We highly recommend your apartment and thanks again for being such friendly, thoughtful hosts that go the extra mile..."
2017-07-29T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,Russell,"Location fantastic, accommodation fantastic, hosts fantastic!We really enjoyed our stay. The place is as advertised. Conveniently situated for leisurely shopping, with great selection of restaurants and a cinema all within walking distance!Thumbs up!"
2017-08-15T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,명아,"우리 부부는 Jared&Diana의 아파트에서 5박 6일을 머물렀습니다. 체크인 하루 전에 주소와  파킹 정보까지  상세한 정보를 보내주셨고, 저희가 늦은 체크인을 했는데도 반갑게 맞아주시고 집안 구석구석  친절히 설명해주셨습니다. 은은한 향초의 향기와  센스있는 인테리어 덕분에 집안에 들어서는 순간  기분이 좋아졌고,  주방기구  세탁기 건조기 등 모든 것이 갖춰져 있는 곳이라  내 집처럼 편안했습니다. 또한 오트밀과 꿀 차등도  준비해주셔서 머무는 내내 든든한 아침 식사도 했구요. 주변에 호수 공원이 있어 저희는 매일 아침 산책하고 힐링했습니다. 커피를 좋아하는 저에겐 커피 머쉰이 없다는 것이 살짝 아쉽긴 했지만 길건너 커피숍이 있어 괜찮았습니다. 조용하고 한적한 곳이지만 Rouse hill town center내에 위치한 곳이라  woolworths나 레스토랑 등 편의시설이 모두 가까워서 편리했습니다. 아파트 자체가  완벽한 보안이 되는 곳이고  rousehill town center 자체적으로 24시간 순찰을 하며 보안에 신경을 쓰는 곳이라ㅇ 안전하고"
2017-10-28T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,Jc,"Diana & Jared's is a nice well equipped Airbnb apartment located in a shopping mall, with a view on a bush and the rising sun from its balcony. 40kms away from CBD, but with all shopping facilities downstairs and a parking place that makes it a perfect location for business needs if you're planning to work somewhere around.Not suitable for a long stay though, if you can't afford to pay for the whole duration upfront. Although my plans for a 3 months stay there were shared with the owner from day one, I discovered another booking had been accepted meanwhile when trying to extend my booking to the third month planned."
2018-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,5604994,Stephen,"Long story short: My original place that I booked for my vacation was a noshow so as a last minute booking, I could not have been happier. It is above a shopping complex but you don't get the noise of the shoppers as you're 5 floors up. It is next to a main bus terminal and eventually on a rail line, so you won't be too far from town. The hosts were super flexible and were always available, if needed. I know when I return to Sydney, I will be booking this place again."
2018-01-29T05:00:00.000Z,5604994,Ashleigh,"Great location, clean, great hosts. Would recommend to anyone looking to stay in the area. Lots of nice little extra touches too - snacks, washing powder etc. the space was a lot bigger then expected. Thanks!"

2018-03-16T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,Katy,"Fantastic on all fronts. True home away from home and met all of my needs (and more!) for the 3wks I stayed. The location is perfect for accessing shops (literally on top of them!) and the bus stop is a 3min walk away for easy travel to the city. The apartment is as beautiful as pictures show, has washer/dryer!, parking was easy, and Diana/Jared were wonderful to work with. They were so friendly and checked in with me to make sure all was going well and to see if I needed anything. Will definitely stay here again in the future! Thank you!"
2018-03-31T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,Amer,"The place is simply amazing, cozy and in a very modern area just above the shopping town center.I highly recommend staying at Jared & Diana’s as they are wonderful hosts."
2018-04-16T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,Ron And Dee,"Location perfect, very convenient.  Coffee shops and stores available as needed. Flat beautifully furnished with artistic design. Thoughtful snacks, cereal, coffee and tea provided. Washer and dryer simplified visit. Top notch security. Friendly welcome and check out. Would love to stay every year."
2018-04-23T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,Jennifer,"I would highly recommend Jared and Diana’s place. It is a beautifully clean, light and airy place. The hosts are very welcoming. The location was perfect for me with the shops just downstairs. I would have extended my stay if that were possible and I would definitely stay again if I needed to visit the area."
2018-04-26T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,Saiful,"The place is immaculate ,spacious,comfortable  mordern,clean and right in the heart of rousehill shopping centre yet you dont feel like it is .Jared and Diana are such amazin hosts and they look after you well and youll be spoilt by their thoughtfullness. We will be back!!"
2018-05-02T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,Issma,"Diane was so hospitable, accommodating and welcoming. The location was perfect and the apartment itself had such a relaxed vibe to it. Would stay again."
2018-06-01T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,Sam,Me and my wife had an amazing stay in their apartment. The location is fantastic and there is good connectivity to the CBD. We loved dining at various restaurants near by and also there  aa beautiful lake near the house which is good for a morning walk. Total value for money.  Thanks Jared for this awesome experience.
2018-06-13T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,Tara,Loved the apartment and Diana and Jared were so helpful.
2018-07-21T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,Aurélie,"Au top!Super accueil, appartement vraiment joli et cosy, très bien situé, tout à proximité pharmacie, commerces, bus...etc"

2018-12-02T05:00:00.000Z,5604994,Michael,"The unit is immaculate right in the center of Rouse Hill shopping center with bars, cafe and restaurants galore. Public transport to downtown Sydney is easy with buses outside the door.  Any questions I had were answered very promptly though was pretty much self sufficient after the first night - outstanding stay"
2019-01-29T05:00:00.000Z,5604994,Lindsay,"We loved staying in Jared and Diana’s appartment.  It’s lovely and stylish and everything you could wish for was provided from shower gel and shampoo to cleaning products and sun tan lotion so we could start enjoying it straight away.  The location is great.  There are lots of lovely shops, supermarkets, coffee shops, places to eat, post office, cinema and bus station. Having said this the appartment is also lovely and quiet. We would not hesitate to recommend it."
2019-02-19T05:00:00.000Z,5604994,Phillip,"Great place and location , recommend this place for everyone visiting Sydney"
2019-02-26T05:00:00.000Z,5604994,Adams,Excellent host and great personality. Easy approachable and make checking easy. I've no issues but she keeping on checking to ensure that I've no concern.  Thanks for be an excellent host.
2012-08-23T04:00:00.000Z,394428,Julie,Stayed with Kerri as we needed somewhere close to the family (who have grown too much to fit us into their small house). Beautiful apartment and a lovely bedroom and bathroom for our use.  Kerri is a great host and a really nice person - with excellent taste.  We'd be happy to recommend her place to anyone and be happy to stay there again.
2012-10-14T04:00:00.000Z,394428,Remon,"Rather than an awesome room, Kerri was really an amazing host, very supportive and sociable. I enjoyed staying with her, it was a nice experience.  She would never hesitate to answer any question or even to offer any kind help."
2012-11-26T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Twiny,"The flat is as per the pictures: decorated with taste, offers nice spaces and is very clean. The room is very pretty and the double bed has a super comfy matress- good sleep guaranteed. It was also much appreciable to have a own bathroom&toilets.Kerri is welcoming and communicating with her was easy (i needed a room for the following day and she replied straight away). I felt comfortable as soon as I arrived, she is such a nice and warm person.Moreover she is full of attention, I did not stay long but the bathroom had been cleaned and new fresh towels provided. It was no problem to use the washing machine (There is a tumble dryer, but also the possibility to have the clothes dry on the balcony). Just felt like home.In short, a quality and easy stay with a fantastic host. I highly recommend anybody to stay at this place.Kerri, I will remember the discussion we had around a glass of wine! Thanks for having hosted me."
2013-01-03T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Katia,"l'hôtesse très sympathique , accueillante, serviable,  nous a fait découvrir la ville et les environs le jour de notre arrivée, l'appartement est confortable, propre et bien décoré, le petit déjeûner copieux, nous avons eu le plaisir de voir avec Kerri le feu d'artifice du 31/12/12 sur sa terrasse ;nous sommes très heureux de l'avoir connue Katia et Pierre  "
2013-01-22T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Remo,"It was a great pleasure to stay in Kerri's house. Everything looked like on the picture. The flat was very tidy and clean. Kerri is a kind, open and helpful person and she knows a lot about the life and the world which means you can have very good discussions with her. I will never forget my stay and I can highly recommend to everyone to stay in Kerri's house!"
2013-06-24T04:00:00.000Z,394428,Kirsten,Kerri's apartment in Petersham was comfortable and convienient for our stay in Sydney. Everything was beautifully presented and the bed was very comfy!  We would stay again.
2013-07-28T04:00:00.000Z,394428,Greg,"Staying with Kerri was my first airbnb experience and it could not have been better. Right from the moment I made the reservation, Kerri welcomed me with an offer of directions, which as it turned out I didn't need as her place was very easy to find. The apartment is beautiful and comfortable with much attention to detail. I was given a great bedroom with a very comfy bed and had my own beautifully appointed private bathroom. The place had the feel of a five star hotel, but with the added bonus of Kerri's friendliness. Immediately downstairs is a very cool cafe serving awesome breakfasts, so I ended up passing up the generous continental style breakfast that Kerri had offered me. The apartment location is perfect, as just down the road is the lively area of Newtown with its many bars and restaurants. I highly recommend staying with Kerri and look forward myself to staying there again in the future."
2013-08-07T04:00:00.000Z,394428,Kirstin,"Perfect host, perfect house and perfect cat! I would stay with Kerri without hesitation. Clean, tidy, modern, friendly, welcoming and relaxed. Perfect!"
2013-09-25T04:00:00.000Z,394428,Gwen,"Kerri hosted my Mother In Law while we had an overflow of guests in our house. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect experience than she got with Kerri. The apartment is like an immaculate hotel, with a very good sized bedroom and uber-modern bathroom for my MIL. Kerri was the perfect host and friend to my MIL, sharing movies, wine, stories and friends with her. Can't quite believe how perfectly it all worked out. Thanks so much Kerri!"
2013-10-21T04:00:00.000Z,394428,Therese,Loved the stay at Kerri's place. Beautifully appointed and fantastic location. The view from the apartment was incredible. Great also having a cool little caf right alongside a gorgeous park. Thanks Kerri for providing a high quality bnb stay. It was really appreciated.
2013-10-28T04:00:00.000Z,394428,Catherine,"Staying at Kerri's was my first experience with Airbnb. It completely exceeded my expectations! I had such a fabulous experience thanks to Kerri. Her home is beautifully decorated and quite comfortable. I immediately felt right at home. Kerri couldn't have been more gracious. She is a very bright, fun-loving person and she made my stay in Sydney very special. I highly recommend staying at Kerri's place!"
2013-11-11T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Catherine,"Second time staying with Kerri. What can I say? Best place to stay in the Sydney area. Not only is this a comfortable, clean home, Kerri is the best host EVER! Absolutely loved my stay here! "
2013-11-19T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Mohammed,"It was great pleasureto stay with Kerry.We felt as we were in our home.Kerry was supportive,friendly,kind and lovely.Her home was not less than what has been shown in the pics.You get all appliances and amenities without trouble.We loved our stay too much amd highly recommend it to anyone.A+++++:)"
2013-11-29T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Anna-Maija,"We are an elderly couple (but not old) from Finland visiting Australia and Sydney for the first time. Staying in Kerris place was also our first airbnb experiance and it is hard to imagine any better place and host for us. We were so pleased and happy all the time, 8 days. It was easy to use public transportation from Stanmore railwaystation. We used everything train, bus, ferry and even light rail. Kerris home is beautyfully furnished, just for our taste. And she had everything in order, very tidy, very organized. We had a very good brekfast and we even enjoyed two dinners with Kerri. Kerri helped us in every way even when we had some problems. We felt like we had visited a good friend. We can warmly suggest Kerris home for everyone. If we ever come to Sydney again we will try to meet Kerri again."
2013-12-02T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Rosemary,"Kerri was a wonderful, very friendly host. The apartment was spotlessly clean and the bed very comfy. "
2013-12-06T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Rod,I visit Sydney for work a few times a year and previously have stayed in motels. It is extremely difficult and expensive to find anything close to the city. So I thought I'd give airbnb a try and Kerri's place looked and sounded great. I was really pleased to have found Kerri's lovely apartment. Very comfortable and well designed and Kerri is the perfect host: even cooked me a lovely meal when I arrived and provided secure parking for my car. Kerri is very friendly and easy-going and you quickly feel like you're staying at an old friends house.Thanks Kerri. I'm sure I'll be looking to stay again on future trips to Sydney
2013-12-09T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Kristy,"Kerri is a wonderful host, she made me feel very welcome and comfortable in her beautifully decorated and clean apartment. Kerri is very accommodating and thoughtful and would totally recommend staying at her lovely home."
2013-12-14T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Adnan,"I had an amazing stay with Kerri. She has a beautiful place that is walking distance from Newtown, a hip neighbourhood where you can spend many hours wandering and discovering quaint shops. Kerri is very hospitable, she picked me up at the train station, and made me feel right at home. The room and the apartment overall are out of a design magazine. Beautifully done. Thanks Kerri!"
2014-01-09T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Sandra,Staying with Kerri in Sydney was wonderful!  She is a lovely hostess whose home is beautiful and comfortable.  Indeed it was my very best Airbnb experience and I have use these listings many times!
2014-01-13T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Julius,"We had a wonderful stay in Kerri s home. She is a great host, all the comments so far speak for themselves. Great location close to the city and the airport, nice neighborhood, wonderful Appartement, everything clean, you'll have your own bathroom. It was perfect for our stay. Kerri responds quickly and was really trying to make everything work out for us. Recommended to everyone."
2014-02-03T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Joanna,Kerri was an amazing host! She immediately made us feel right at home and treated us like family. I highly recommend her very nice apt for anyone wanting to stay in a central area in Sydney.
2014-02-09T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Jennifer,"Kerrie is a wonderful host, could not have asked for better. Beautiful apartment, very clean and great to have your own ensuite. Would love to come and stay again one day!"
2014-02-20T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Julie,We've stayed a few times with Kerri.  She's a great host and her apartment is lovely.  We're happy to recommend and look forward to our next visit.
2014-02-23T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Jack,"Kerri's place was conveniently situated only about 20 minutes walk to theatres and restaurants in Newtown and about 20 mins drive to the airport for Saturday morning pick up. The bed was very comfortable, lovely bathroom and living area and Kerri was a helpful host. Being under the flight path was a novelty for our very short stay (and no planes overnight). However, the traffic noise from the busy main road was a bit of a problem for us and woke us up early. Although for convenience of location I would consider staying there again."
2014-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Gudrun,Kerri is a very nice person and a great host. The location was simply perfect for me…everything was how Kerri descried. I can recommend Kerri.
2014-03-09T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Thomas,"Great host, great time!! We really enjoyed our stay in Petersham, we discovered Sydney by train and bus - erverything close by. Kerry gave us a lot of brilliant tips and made us feeling like home. Thanks for everything, looking foreward to see you again, Thomas and Margarteha from Germany"
2014-03-17T04:00:00.000Z,394428,Shane,Kerri was the perfect host kind and couldn't do enough for us we felt like part of the family .The apartment was gorgeous  and central to railway and shops our bed was very comfortable and ensuite  was nice and fresh and recently renovated .We enjoyed our stay in Sydney and will come back and hopefully come and stay with Kerri again .

2014-04-01T04:00:00.000Z,394428,Graham,Kerri's was a lovely place to stay and she was both friendly and helpful too. It was only a short 15 minute train ride to the centre of Sydney so with a my multipass it was easy.Listen to kerri's hints and tips as Watson's bay was truly fabulous.
2014-04-15T04:00:00.000Z,394428,Lise,"I arrived at Kerri's place, and thought, Hmmm...when can I move in? This is a fabulous apartment, and Kerri is a generous, thoughtful host who contributed a great deal to making my stay in Sydney very enjoyable indeed. Plus, we had a lot in common, which made for some lovely conversations! I would heartily recommend this place to travelers seeking a fine welcome in a beautiful apartment. Only word of note: if you're someone who needs absolute quiet, it's a bit noisy on weekday mornings (not weekends, which are much quieter).   "
2014-05-12T04:00:00.000Z,394428,Julie,"Another great stay with Kerri, room lovely as always. "
2014-07-25T04:00:00.000Z,394428,Chelsie,Kerri was very nice and accommodating. Unfortunately I was unable to stay last omits but she was a pleasure to communicate with and will definitely be a place for next time! Thanks Kerri!
2014-08-12T04:00:00.000Z,394428,Helen,A wonderful first AirBNB experience for us. A beautiful welcoming home with charming decorations and Kerri is an excellent host. She greeted us with a glass of wine and gave us good advice on trains and where to eat.  We slept in a comfortable big bedroom with good lighting and elegant furnishings. Will stay there again.
2014-08-18T04:00:00.000Z,394428,Jane,"My husband and I spent four nights at Kerris.The accomodation was great,lovely bedroom and bathroom,clean and uncluttered.Kerri was a warm and friendly host and very welcoming- nothing was too much trouble.The location is fabulous,cafés and transport on the doorstep.Even the cat was friendly."
2014-10-21T04:00:00.000Z,394428,Bernard,"Our first australian experience was at Kerri's home. The place is located at 20 min from CBD and 2 train-stations from a vibrant and colorful place called Newton. Kerri has been more than helpful, provinding us with usefull and detailed information about Sydney and its surbubs, places of interest and much more. Everything was exactly as described. We are really looking forward to spending some more time in her apartment in a fortnight."
2014-11-05T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Bernard,"Kerri is a wonderful host! She is warm, friendly and helpful. She even drove us around to visit Sydney. Her apartment is nice and spacious enough to enjoy a comfortable stay. The location is on walking distance to public transportation. If we are ever back in Sydney, we would have no hesitation to stay with Kerri again. Highly recommend! Thanks for a great stay !"

2014-11-19T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Barb,"Kerri’s place and Kerrie are special, even better than the pictures.  I selected Kerri’s accommodation for ease of commuting by train and the beautiful décor.  I balked at the prospect of hauling all my luggage up a slight hill to her place, and Kerri cheerfully was at the Petersham station in 5 minutes on a Saturday afternoon to drive me to her apartment.  I found the Stanmore Station (less than a 15 minute walk past some nice houses) easier, and walked it at night and felt safe.  I was at Kerri’s for a demanding conference, and being at her place was like a relaxing resort.  The home ambiance is so beautiful and the plant and sun make it a very special home away from home.  Some of the memorable touches:  really soft sheets, a well-appointed private bathroom, a friendly cat, the self-serve breakfast of fruit/cereal/yogurt laid out in the morning (one morning she left eggs and a tomato with a pan and spatula too), the plants and view from the veranda where I ate and read, and the lovely decorations from her travels.  There’s also a nice, upscale grocery just down the street.  We didn’t see too much of each other, and the lengthiest time we spent was when Kerri generously took me to my rental car office in Mascot near the airport.   Kerri’s friendly and adaptable when you have odd plans like I did.  It was a treat to stay here!  "
2014-12-03T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Jessica,Great place and a lovey apartment! Highly recommended! I would definitely stay here again in Sydney!
2014-12-09T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Lisa,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Kerri's place. She is a wonderful host and very welcoming. There was a delicious cooked dinner on my arrival and a lovely Breakfast laid out for me to help myself in the morning. I enjoyed sitting on the spacious balcony looking back towards Sydney. The whole place is very clean. The bedroom is spacious and the bed very comfortable. I enjoyed my own bathroom with plenty of fresh towels. Kerry's place is a lovely peaceful home away from home.  I would come back anytime I am in Sydney. Thank you very much Kerri.
2015-01-19T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Eleanor,"Staying at Kerri's place was absolutely wonderful! Kerri is an awesome host, very friendly, warm, welcoming and great to talk to. She always ensured I was comfortable and even drove me to the next place I was staying in Dulwich Hill. A lovely breakfast of fruit, cereal and yoghurt was laid out for me to help myself every morning and Kerri made a yummy cooked breakfast for me on my last morning. I also enjoyed dinner a couple of times with Kerri which was great, she is a fantastic cook! The room was lovely, clean, really nicely decorated and with its own modern bathroom. I also loved the chocolates! Wish I could have stayed longer, I would definitely stay again. Thanks Kerri! "
2015-02-28T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Lee,"Kerri was very welcoming for minute one,the apartment is lovely & nothing is to much for kerri,she always helps & advises which is a great help,kerri joined me & my family for dinner out one evening which says how easy a person she is to get on with,I fully recommend a stay here & will defiantly stay here again when I come back to Sydney"

2015-09-29T04:00:00.000Z,394428,Ruth,"Our first ever Airbnb experience was just perfect.  Kerri is a lovely host, the apartment is very stylish and we had a yummy breakfast too.  We couldn't have asked for anymore.  Kerri was very efficient from the first point of contact and we were made to feel very welcome.  She gave really good restaurant recommendations which is always nice when staying in a new area.  The train station is close so  it made everything accessible.  We will definitely stay here again."
2015-10-04T04:00:00.000Z,394428,Annette,"Had a great stay with Kerry who is a wonderful host. The location is excellent, just a short walk to Stanmore or Petersham stations with quick trips to the city and airport. Kerry's home is very clean and well laid out with plenty of privacy and your own bathroom. A great video and book library, beautiful deck area for meals and just relaxing...what more could you need? Breakfast was laid out and Kerry even cooked me a meal on arrival and picked me up from my daughters place. A wonderful host, beautiful home..... I'll be back!   Thank you so much Kerry"

We walked less than 10 mins from Petersham station. The host prepared some fresh fruits, milk and toast for us for breakfast and we liked it very much. We will choose here to stay if we come Australlia again."
2015-12-05T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Bernard,"It was the 3rd time we stayed at Kerri’s place and it was as perfect as the 1st time.The room is nicely decorated and big enough for accommodate comfortably 2 people and the bathroom next door was for our private use only. Kerri is a very communicative and interesting person, always ready for a chat and a glass of wine on the terrace or in the large living area.The apartment is well located, on walking distance from Stanmore train station, which is at about 20 min from CBD.I would recommend this place without hesitation to anyone who is looking for a comfy stay in Sydney."
2015-12-08T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Jodie,"We stayed with Kerri after we had moved house and before flying to Europe for a holiday and it was exactly what we needed! Kerri is a lovely, thoughtful host, offering us breakfast for the morning and making sure we were comfortable. Her place is really lovely, the bed is very comfy and the shower is the best! It's also very conveniently located to the cafes, shopping and nightspots of Newtown and Enmore, with the city a short train ride away. I would highly recommend Kerri's to others looking for a Sydney stay. "

Kerri make you feeling at home. She also help me to be able to find the way to see the koala refuge. Thanks Kerri, for sure if I have the chance to go to Sydney again I will ask you if a can stay at your place again. "
2016-05-08T04:00:00.000Z,394428,Tony,This is the second time I've stayed at Kerri's place.  Kerri is a friendly and generous host who takes great care with the appearance of her beautiful home.  Easy to organise a check-in time.  Handy location only a 5 minute walk to Petersham station.   Good value.
2016-11-17T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Lynette,Kerri is a fantastic host and I truly enjoyed my visit. I would recommend Kerri and her apartment to anyone.

2017-01-18T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Angela,"We had a wonderful time staying with Kerri for almost three weeks.  She is a fantastic host and made us feel truly welcome in her lovely home.  We especially enjoyed the delicious fresh fruit salad prepared freshly every day to accompany breakfast.  The property is only a few minutes away from the train station, just 15 mins to the centre of the city, ideal for Sydney sightseeing.  Newtown, with its vibrant shops and estaurants is just a short walk away which was excellent for us as we became regular visitors to the Cow and Moon (voted best ice cream in the world).  We have no hesitation recommending Kerri and will definitely stay again when we next return to Australia."
2017-03-09T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Louretta,"Beautiful apartment with a great balcony looking out to the lights of the city , where we enjoyed one or two wines .

2017-05-06T04:00:00.000Z,394428,Hannah,"Kerri was such a welcoming and friendly host who went out of her way to ensure my stay was comfortable. The apartment was immaculate, the bedroom spacious and the facilities modern. The location was perfect, with everything I needed within walking distance. For my first airbnb experience it was perfect, would highly recommend and will be staying there again!"
2017-10-01T04:00:00.000Z,394428,Tim,"What a pleasant surprise after a string of ""less than expected"" experiences on air BnB.    The secure parking and lifts are just the beginning.  Kerri has created a delightfully modern and stylish home that lends itself to being shared.   Truly tasteful and functional bathroom, and it was all mine.  It all continues upstairs with the perfect kitchen, a sun filled dining and lounge area, flowing  out onto large private deck with views of a vast city skyline, including the harbour bridge, which is probably ten kilometres  away.   Truly magnificent.  Yes there are some big noises from the road out front  and the jumbo jets above, but it really isn't a problem.  Kerri loves this space and who wouldn't."
2017-12-03T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Louretta,"Kerri's apartment is in a very handy location to restaurants,shops and trains. Easy to get into the city. Great views from the balcony.  Kerri's hospitality is outstanding . I had a wonderful time . Thank you."

2018-06-18T04:00:00.000Z,24498566,Georgia,"Beautiful room with a surprisingly lovely view, loads of sunlight in the room and such a comfy bed. The house is in such a great position, so close to Central and Surry hills, was sad to have had such a short stay. The stairs up to the room are very steep so make sure to watch your step! Thank you for a wonderful stay Felicity, I had a great time."
2016-01-03T05:00:00.000Z,7901220,Sandy,"Anat was a fantastic host from the very beginning. She was very responsive during the booking process and flexible with my family's arrival, which helped us greatly arriving in a new country. The house is a beautifully renovated 3 bedroom in South Coogee with tons of natural light and outdoor lounge space. The kitchen was well supplied for us to cook and bake, and we were surprised to see the BBQ was hooked up to the main gas line. Very cool!We drove most of the trip, but there are also nearby bus lines that take you into Sydney proper in 45 mins or so. I highly recommend this BnB and am excited for all that have the opportunity to stay here :)."
2018-02-15T05:00:00.000Z,23171144,Jannette,"The apartment was great, exactly as advertised. Oriel was fantastic, everything was super easy. Highly recommend, 11/10."

2018-03-11T05:00:00.000Z,23171144,Gina,"Oriel was a great host, he responded within seconds to every message we sent, arranged extra blankets to be delivered in minutes and made check-in and check-out extremely stress free when we had such a busy schedule to work around.  The unit was clean and had everything we needed to accomodate us for our doTERRA Convention stay.  I will definitely contact Oriel if we require accommodation in Sydney again. There is a great little Italian Restaurant directly downstairs, along with a convenience store, and pub within 50 metres. Walk to George Street or Darling Harbour in minutes.  Ideal location.   thanks Oriel!"
2018-03-16T04:00:00.000Z,23171144,Nicole,"Oriel is a fabulous host. He was super friendly and responsive and met us at the apartment to show us around.The apartment itself is in a fabulous location with great views over to Darling Harbour and easy walk to nearby cafes and city shopping. It has a gym and pool.Compared to hotels around it’s an absolute bargain. There’s a hefty cleaning fee but assuming that stays the same no matter how long you stay. We only stayed one night so proportionally it was a lot but if you stayed over a longer period the per night rate would be less. Even so it was still very economically priced.It’s fully furnished but otherwise empty, and although not absolutely brand new it’s in great condition and clean and tidy. It’s just as described and in the photos."

We were 2 couples and the 2 bedroom/2bathrooms was ideal. Overall was perfect for what we were looking for, for a long weekend break."
2018-07-19T04:00:00.000Z,23171144,Uma,"Nice place to stay in Sydney, close to attractions."
2018-07-28T04:00:00.000Z,23171144,Christophe,Perfect location in city centre
2018-08-13T04:00:00.000Z,23171144,Evelyn,"Oriel was an easy host to deal with, check in and out was straight forward. The apartment is bright and spacious with a good views towards Darling Harbour. If you want to be close to Darling Harbour this place is perfect as its roughly a 5-10minute walk down the road depending on your speed. Its also central enough to walk to The Rocks, Circular Quay, Hyde Park, Sky Tower, and shops, all roughly 20mins and if you're coming home late or with bags of shopping the public transport costs are reasonable. There is traffic noise but not anything I wouldnt expect in such a central city location and the apartment is several stories up so the noise is not excessive.  Overall i wouldnt have any issue recommending the apartment to family/friends. "
2018-08-19T04:00:00.000Z,23171144,Clinton,A fantastic host who made everything easy. Highly recommended.
2018-08-26T04:00:00.000Z,23171144,Kate,"Bigger than expected, this apartment provided the perfect stay for us in Sydney. Handy to everything, lovely outlook to the water and nice and tidy. Oriel responded quickly to any queries and provided a smooth check in/out process. Will be back!"

2018-09-13T04:00:00.000Z,23171144,Donghoon,the location was just fabulous. only 5 min walk to Barangaroo and heart of Sidney.Oriel was perfect host with warm heart.however smoke alarm was little bit sensitive. I was just cooking my steak with hoods on with high function but the alarm rang so easily. Otherwise his place was just perfect.
2018-09-16T04:00:00.000Z,23171144,Adam,"We had a great weekend here as an extended family. The oldest was 95 and the youngest 8 months, and everyone was comfortable. Our host organised a cot for our baby and access for the oldies was easy. There's a nice view of Darling Harbour from the lounge/balcony and it's just steps away from Barangaroo, ferries, restaurants, and the city of course."
2018-09-21T04:00:00.000Z,23171144,Trey,Great location! Enjoyed our visit.

2018-11-21T05:00:00.000Z,23171144,Elliott,"Great location (easy walk to just about everything), very accommodating hospitality by Oriel, however the apartment might be a bit tight for 5 people so I would recommend either 4 or less to stay there.  The view from the balcony was very cool as well!  Overall great experience."
2018-11-22T05:00:00.000Z,23171144,Monica,"Great location, tidy and clean modern apartment, very easy access to Darling Harbour area and the inner city. Treat yourselves to lunch at Machiavelli in Clarence street, a three minute walk. Having two separate bathrooms was bonus and view of the harbour from the bedrooms and the living room was lovely. Oriel was excellent with his communication and his check in instructions and the three of us really enjoyed our stay. Thank you!"

2018-12-07T05:00:00.000Z,23171144,Gerry,Perfect location close to Darling Harbour and an easy walk to Circular Quey and Chinatown. The apartment is spacious and has everything needed for a trip to Sydney. Would definitely stay again!
2018-12-20T05:00:00.000Z,23171144,Narelle,"Oriel is a  wonderful host. He was quick, clear and warm in all his communication.  The apartment is very well equipped and in an absolutely fantastic location within a safe, clean and modern building. Being a frequently used property it is showing some signs of wear but I wouldn't hesitate to book in here again."
2018-12-25T05:00:00.000Z,23171144,Adam,We really enjoyed our time in Sydney. The accommodation was ideally located and exactly as described. We found the accommodation no problem with a 20 minute ride from the airport. An easy 15 minutes walk to the ferry terminal and The Rocks. Thanks again Oriel!
2018-12-29T05:00:00.000Z,23171144,Madison,Fantastic apartment in a great location. Some lovely little touches through out the apartment made us very at home. Will definitely keep this apartment in mind when visiting Sydney again. Thanks Oriel.

2019-01-15T05:00:00.000Z,23171144,Fernanda,Muy lindo departamento y muy bien ubicado. El anfitrión siempre estuvo a nuestra disposición.
2019-01-17T05:00:00.000Z,23171144,Kari,Clean apartment with a nice view. Public transportation was easy to find and good restaurants nearby.
2019-01-22T05:00:00.000Z,23171144,Penny,A good few days once we arrived although we dealt with Chen and the phone number on the listing does not relate. A bit dated but provided everything described. My husband was getting spiked by the couch in the living area but just had to be careful. It is in walking distance to the Wharfs and the city bus tour bus stop is close by with tickets being purchased on the wharf
2019-01-27T05:00:00.000Z,23171144,Hunter,"Great position,great host we will definitely return to this apartment"
2019-01-30T05:00:00.000Z,23171144,Katrina,"Oriel’s spacious apartment is in a terrific location, just a short walk to Darling Harbour restaurants, harbour tours and water taxis. Plenty of shopping close by at King and George and we found the distance to the Circular Quay area (Sydney Opera House, The Rocks, Botanical Gardens, Sydney Bridge) very walkable. The apartment kitchen had all the amenities we needed and more! I’d recommend Oriel’s place as a great base for touring Sydney. He was very kind to allow us to store our luggage before check-in, which was a huge help. This was our first visit to Sydney, we would definitely come back. :)"
2019-02-04T05:00:00.000Z,23171144,Gary,A great position very central  to transport markets Circular Quay and Darling Harbour.
2019-02-06T05:00:00.000Z,23171144,수정,신속한 피드백과 위치가 좋아서 여행하기 편했어요
2019-02-09T05:00:00.000Z,23171144,Lynne,Great location amenities to share for travelling couples 2 bedroom and bath
2019-02-14T05:00:00.000Z,23171144,Ajit,This place is great location wise and is within walking distance of Sydney’s most popular attractions of Darling Harbour.
2019-02-18T05:00:00.000Z,23171144,Kelsi,"We really enjoyed our stay at Oriel's, it had everything we needed.The location was great, nice and central and close to public transport. Made for a great place to base ourselves, for our first time in Sydney."
2019-02-21T05:00:00.000Z,23171144,Jill,Grateful to the cleaners allowing us to leave our luggage in the room before check in. Apartment in excellent location. Departure delayed as the fire alarm went off and we had to evacuate the building. Not a huge problem for us and better to be safe than sorry but it's a long walk down.
2019-02-24T05:00:00.000Z,23171144,Melissa,Great location and great communication!!
2019-03-04T05:00:00.000Z,23171144,Patti,"This two bedroom apt. Has a nice partial view of water and boats. However, it only sleeps four adults comfortably unless you can sleep in a children’s metal cot with a thin foam pad, both of which were broken when we got there. It took several   texts, frustration and waiting, but we did get a functional cot that night. Having only two nights in Sydney, we didn’t need the aggravation. Also, we were really grossed out by the black mold in the bathroom shower grout lines."
2019-03-06T05:00:00.000Z,23171144,Ian,"Lovely apartment in the heart of the city with view towards Darling Harbour, well presented and clean"
2016-07-11T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Andrea,"Millie's studio was perfect! Fantastic location, easy walk to the train and amazing views of the bridge. Millie was quick to respond to my questions and very accommodating with my early check in. Would 100% stay her again. Thanks Millie :) "
2016-07-13T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Savanna,Our stay with Millie was absolutely wonderful. Matched the description with a lovely view of the Harbour Bridge. Very spacious apartment within 5 minutes from Lunar Park. Easy access via train and water ferry. Lovely stay!
2016-07-21T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Ritchie,"Millie was a wonderful host. The studio was super clean and tidy, and had good wifi and a comfortable bed. Best of all, though, was the amazing view to enjoy from the little balcony. I will definitely recommend to friends."
2016-07-25T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Daphane,"Millie was a fantastic host! The studio located in the perfect spot - super close to the CBD, but not too close from the hustle and bustle as well. It's only a short 5-10 walk from the train station to the apartment, and the streets are well lit at night so it's safe. Studio itself was clean, neat and comfortable.Will be staying here again if I find myself in Sydney again!"
2016-08-06T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Chantal,"Fab stay, Millie was so helpful as our plans had changed due to work and flight cancellations but she helped us immensely and was no issues.Absolutely love the location and view wished we could have booked for longer! Perfect home away from home so cosy and homely! Thank you so much for sharing your home enabling us to book it and making our 1st week moving to Sydney so nice!"
2016-08-11T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Pluie,"Perfect experience! The location, the room, the view, the cereal, the xbox, everything is great! I'll definitely recommend to a friend or book again next time if I'm going to Sydney again. Thank you Millie!"
2016-08-14T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Bianca,"My daughter and I loved staying at this gorgeous little apartment.  Although the space is small, the furniture and lay out work really well and the place was very tidy.  We felt comfortable in the space, especially because our host went out of her way to make sure we felt welcome. The location is fabulous - close to the train or ferry and within walking distance of the harbour bridge, Luna park, Kirabilli and Wendy's secret garden.  The view from the balcony is gorgeous and we were lucky enough to see fireworks on Saturday night and have some native birds come and visit us in the morning.  Thank you Millie! This is why I love airbnb! "
2016-08-20T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Olivia,"Great place, helpful host, would highly recommend. "
2016-08-26T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Kevin,Millie's apartment is just as advertised. Very clean and tidy but it got a bit cold at night due to no heating system. Millie was prepared though and supplied two thick blankets which made up for it. Overall great experience and very close to the opera house and bridge.
2016-09-19T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Karine,"Great location - so close to the train station, great place - nice, clean and tidy, Millie is a fantastic host.  I will be staying here again. Thanks Millie! "
2016-09-28T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Odhran,Millie was a wonderful host and all was as described - highly recommended.
2016-10-01T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Geissy,Millie's place was so pretty and cosy. It's got everything you need. The apartment is also located in a very nice area close to the city and amenities. Every morning you wake up to the harbor bridge view! Millie was also very helpful and flexible to accommodate our needs. She was very easy to talk to and help us feel like home. Definitely a nice place to stay when traveling in Sydney. 
2016-10-10T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Nick,This was a perfect location for our stay in Sydney. A five minute walk to the harbour bridge and lots of restaurants within minutes of the apartment. Millie was an excellent host and very willing to offer anything we needed. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone.
2016-10-15T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Louisa,"Millie was a lovely host, super friendly and great at communicating in the lead up to our stay. The studio is really cute, compact and well designed with some nice touches - coffee machine, emergency toiletries. A great stay, thanks! "
2016-10-17T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Rodrigo,fantastic place. thanks so much
2016-10-23T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Marilyn,"Millie's place was as she described it and we found it quite comfortable, everything we needed, a cute little place!  The situation is very convenient, the walk to Kirribilli shops, Milson's Point station and the Nth Sydney ferry was only minutes.  It was wonderful looking at the view over to the Harbour Bridge.  Millie met us on arrival and explained details of her place which was very helpful."
2016-10-23T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Kevin,Great view great hospitallity...
2016-10-27T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Shannon,"Lovely studio apartment with a very welcoming host, who ensured all the comforts of home were taken care of, as well as extras such as toiletries and brekky."
2016-10-31T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Thalia,"Millie was an excellent host and had gone out of her way to make sure we felt welcome. She was always friendly and quick to reply to our questions. Her attention to detail and thoughtfulness included a handy one-page reference card (how to use the coffee machine, where to find the light switches, etc) and some menus from the local takeaway places. The unit was clean and matched it's photos and description. It was a short walk from the train station (easy even with a suitcase) and there was no noise from the train line. We would definitely stay here again. It was like staying at a tidy friend's house.The view is superb. "
2016-11-06T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Natasha,"So easy to get around with public transport a short walk away, the apartment was really clean & comfy, the view was amazing, Millie was easy to communicate with, I would definitely stay here again."
2016-11-11T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Joanne Sullivan,"Fabulous apartment, central location, great facilities and million dollar views!Within walking distance to a fabulous array of dining experiences plus the pubs of both Kirribilli and North Sydney! What more could you ask for!"
2016-11-19T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Kim,"Millie was great at instructing us how to get to her place and everything we needed to know once we were there. The space itself was nice and private. The one downfall is there is a lot of street noise all throughout the night and especially in the early morning when people start to head to work. So if you're a light sleeper, you might want to book elsewhere. "
2016-11-24T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Julia,Millie's place was the perfect location for our stay in Sydney. Just a few meters to the next bus stop and only a few minutes to train station and harbour bridge. The studio was clean and matched the description and had a great view to the bridge.Would definetly recommend this!
2016-12-01T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Fiona,"Clear and quick communication with easy instructions for check in/out and how to find Millie's apartment.  Millie's studio had everything I needed for my week in Sydney, and is conveniently located within walking distance to the train, shops and restaurants.  I appreciated Millie's generous sharing of the kitchen equipment and the instructions on the bench made everything easy.  The bed was comfy and the bedding, towels etc. were a convenient touch.  I loved the view too - a wine on the deck watching the bridge light up was just what I needed at the end of each day! "
2016-12-06T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Khaled,"I stayed in Millie's place with my wife through our short visit to Sydney, and it was a delight. The place is a walking distance to the restaurants and cafes in Kirribilli, and a one train station away from the city. The station is almost 7-minute walk from the building. Millie did her best to make us feel at home. She provided us with many goodies for breakfast, and made sure we get entertained through her movie and game collection.I would definitely recommend Millie's place for anyone visiting Sydney, and I would check it out for availability next time I'm planning to visit."
2016-12-13T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Cornelius,"Millie provided us with a really cosy apartment in a really awesome area. There are really cool restaurants at the foot of the bridge at Miltons Point. We took the ferry to get there or walked over the bridge. What a fascinating city. And what a spectecular view from Millies apartment. Thanks Millie, we had a great time."
2016-12-21T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Matt,We loved the apartment and would love to stay there again in the future. The location was great to get to the centre of Sydney and also the ferry system. The view from the balcony was amazing and the apartment was well equipped (even catering for emergency amenities). Millie was always on hand and very quick to reply to our messages. Thanks for being a great host.
2016-12-29T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Elaine,"We stayed at Millie's place four nights and congratulated ourselves on a good choice, mainly because of the location. It is in North Sydney which puts it into a lower price bracket, but it is a 5-10 minute walk to the North Sydney ferry which takes you right to Circular Quay, which is the public transportation hub and next to the opera house. You can even buy your public transport pass at the little store next to Millie's. Also, the apartment has a balcony with a stunning view of the Sydney Harbour bridge and skyline. These things compensate for the apartment's tiny size and lack of air conditioning. Millie left us with a lot of breakfast food plus coffee and milk. The kitchen was clean and well equipped. The bed converts from a day bed to a double, and even if we had done it correctly it would have required strength and lifting. If you are not young and strong get her to leave the bed set up for you. The apartment is charming and clean but the public areas of the building, including the laundry room, could use freshening, but don't let that put you off. We would stay there again."
2017-01-10T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Helene,"It was a beautiful stay in this lovely studio, we enjoyed the time there.And Millie is a great host, the conversation was really good!Thanks very much!!"
2017-01-22T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Rachel,It was super easy to get to places and we loved walking over the bridge every day.
2017-01-26T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Deborah,"Millie's flat was clean, comfortable and centrally located within short walk to ferry and train and just a couple of stops to city. Also, cafes and shops close by."
2017-02-02T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Shweta,"Great location, close to public transport and comfortable apartment. Millie was a great and welcoming host."
2017-02-05T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Nora,Millie's place is just as described. We had a wonderful view from the balcony that we enjoyed having our dinner and breakfast to. Location is great too as it is so near the train station and Milson's point for ferry rides. Definitely happy we made the right choice :)
2017-02-08T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Yuyue,"Thank you !!!Thank you for your patience, thank you for providing us with such a warm environment!!"
2017-02-14T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Alec,"Location fantastic, we needed aircon  the fan just did not cope and some place to put our clothes, it is Millies house but we feel she could have made some cupboard and hanging space otherwise really nice"
2017-02-22T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Mathias,Millie is a good host. Check in and check out was without hassle. Millie was available if we needed her. Thank you Millie!
2017-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Alex,"Millie's ""shoebox"" (as she calls it) is an adorable little corner of North Sydney with easy access to trains and buses. Plenty of nearby food and drink, and her recommendations will definitely enhance your stay. Check in/out was easy as could be. Would stay again!"

2017-03-15T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Trudy,Had a lovely stay at Millie's.  Only a 15-20 minute walk to Circular Quay over the Sydney Harbour Bridge.  Very convenient.  Many thanks
2017-03-21T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Karen,We had a wonderful stay! Millie's studio is really cosy and was perfect for 2 of us. It also has a great view of the Harbour Bridge and was close to public transport. Checking in and out was also really easy. Would recommend and stay again.

2017-03-30T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Paula,"Perfect unit, clean, cosy and so handy to all north Sydney has to offer. Millie is a great host, communication was excellent. Definitely recommend and will definitely re-book on my next trip to city. Excellent value"
2017-04-06T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Sally,"Millie's space is just great! It's such a well designed little unit that it didn't feel small even for 2 for 6 nights. We appreciated the spaces to hang and store clothes and the bathroom shelves. Thanks, Millie!The stunning view has been mentioned several times but we also liked the proximity to Kirribilli and other neighbourhoods like Neutral Point (Thelma & Louise's for food!) also The Cremorne Coastal walk is worth it.Getting in and out of Sydney is a breeze. Lots of eating places nearby.Would highly recommend! "
2017-04-12T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Kayla,Our stay in Millie's Studio was perfect! The location is very easy to access public transportation or to walk across the bridge. Millie provided detailed notes for her studio and had everything we needed. We would definitely stay here again!
2017-04-18T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Christopher,"Everything was just great! It is a cozy little apartment near the Sydney center. Clean and you got everything you need for your stay. Public transport is basically in front of your door. Next time we are in Sydney, we would love to come back! Thank you for letting us stay in your home! "
2017-04-22T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Anna & Michael,We very much enjoyed staying in Millie's lovely and very well presented apartment. It's very easy to get to from the airport/city and in a part of town that's a delight to wander (if you can tear yourself away from the balcony with its view of the Harbour Bridge).
2017-04-30T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Marija,"Good communication, lovely view and clean homey apartment !"
2017-05-05T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Koizumi,The room is so cute & good location!I had a breakfast at the balcony & could see the harbur brigde every morning;)And Millie is so kind!I just wanna stay again.and I like SYD more!!
2017-05-10T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Derek,"Great communication, accurate description of the space, perfect location and full of character. Overall an amazing experience and highly recommended. I will definitely be staying here again when I'm back in Sydney. "
2017-05-13T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Zosia,"I loved Millie's home! I came to Sydney for work and booked Millie's home for the convenience of having everything close by. I ended up spending an afternoon indoors because it felt so homely and cosy. The bed is super comfortable and it was difficult to get up in the mornings! The view from the balcony is amazing and I loved seeing the city skyline and harbour bridge lit up at night. There was plenty of cafes and restaurants within walking distance and the neighbourhood is beautiful.Millie herself was a wonderful host, very welcoming and accommodating. Communication was great.I cannot recommend this space enough :)"
2017-05-19T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Murray,"Cozy little space with lots of inclusions and views of the bridge.  Walking distance to North Sydney train station, cafes and restaurants. "
2017-05-22T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Dominique,"I would highly recommend staying at this place.Millie is an incredible host, so accommodating and very swift with communication.The apartment is the perfect size, tidy and cosy, with a very thoughtful use of space. We looked forward to coming home to the space every day. The view is spectacular just like the photos, with a cute balcony to look over the area.  Staying here was perfect with so many public transport options near by, getting into the city or going to crows nest was too easy.  Attention to detail has been paid to make guests feel so at home here, would definitely stay here again!!"
2017-05-28T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Adam,"Millie's apartment is very close to the train station and in front of a bus stop. Additionally, there are many little cafes within walking distance. Millie was great at communicating with me prior to the trip to provide me with helpful details regarding the apartment, she made check-in seamless. The apartment was clean, cozy, and had everything we needed - even tea! Thanks for the hospitality."
2017-06-03T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Sojan,"I really loved millie's apartment , close to all public transport and harbour bridge . Nice view of the sky while in the bed and harbour bridge . Communication with millie was really good. I would recommend this plce and will be back again "
2017-06-12T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Jen,"Millie's place is an absolute delight. The location is excellent, and although she lives in the apartment when she's not leasing it, it is neat as a pin, well organised and thoughtfully presented. The bed is very comfortable, the bathroom is clean and tidy and the kitchen is very usable. Millie mentions that the place is small, but for a solo traveller it is perfectly perfect. I think two people would also be just fine there. Loved it, and look forward to staying again at some stage."
2017-06-28T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Boris,"Everything was exactly as promised. It is a small studio, comfortable and clean. It is close to restaurants and public transport that can take you wherever you want to go. Millie's instructions were clear and communication via the app was excellent. Very fast wifi. I never actually met the host in person but I had a very comfortable and pleasant stay. "
2017-07-02T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Kristina,"The appartment is well situated, just a 10 min walk to catch a picturesque ferry journey to Circular Quay. Inside is really cosy and well designed. The bed was super comfy and Millie was a great host. All in all really enjoyable stay!"
2017-07-10T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Machete,"Fantastic location, cute little place, has everything you need. We spent 2 nice nights in watching DVDs from Millie's large collection! Would definitely recommend. "
2017-07-16T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Herve,"Une excellente adresse à Sydney, idéalement placée : à quelques centaines de mètres du train ou du ferry!Que demander de plus? Peut être une coupe de champagne à déguster sur le balcon en admirant au loin( pas si loin!) le Magnifique Harbour Bridge!!! A ne pas rater!!;merci Millie,!!!"
2017-08-03T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Ebru,"Great stay, lovely apartment with an amazing view of the Sydney harbour bridge"
2017-08-13T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Mel,"You will love staying at Millie's. The studio was small but perfectly decorated. It well equipped too! The view is priceless really. It's my favorite park of the stay. In terms of convenience, the Bus stop is right outside the property, 12 minutes walk to the train station, and a few minutes to the wharf. Millie as host was nothing but an angel. Check in instructions were spot on, communication was consistent, and very gracious with check in time. I already miss the studio :)... Will definitely stay here again in the future! :)"
2017-08-18T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Erin,Millie's place was tops. I was in Sydney for work and it felt like coming home every night instead of a sterile hotel suite. I would gladly stay again. So clean and exactly as Mille described. Thanks so much.
2017-09-05T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Chiara,"Millie's place is perfect for a stay in Sydney.  We walked to Ferry's loved the restaurants in KIRRIBILLI,  really enjoyed our short stay."
2017-09-08T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Juliette,"Yes, the view is everything you see in that photo, it is not faked, and yes it is to die for. Millie's studio is in a wonderful location, both convenient to shops, restaurants and public transport, yet stylish and glamorous. Both Kirribili/Milsons Point and North Sydney are  10 minute walks away. Her studio apartment is in a fabulous mid-century modern complex and she has arranged and furnished very much in period style with a few quirky popular culture and present day tweaks. It is a light-filled and generous space especially for the solo traveller. Whilst it is in a very busy district, there was not too much traffic disturbance and I could sleep well and comfortably.  Millie was also a thoughtful and generous host, who has excellent clear communication, has worked out simple and efficient processes for check-in and has second guessed the needs of travellers, and catered to them. One felt like a welcomed guest not a paying customer. Thank you and good luck to the talented and creative Millie"
2017-09-17T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Mark,"Awesome!  Location within about 5 minutes of the train station.  Nice neighborhood...felt like I was ""coming home"" every evening as I walked from the station.  Apartment has everything you need and a great view of the Harbor Bridge from the balcony.  Thanks Millie!"
2017-09-23T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Laurie,Very convenient
2017-09-30T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Thao,"This has to be one of the best locations I've been to around Sydney. My partner and I enjoyed the place very much and everything was so convenient for us, especially going out. Her place was well equipped and very clean. Would recommend!"
2017-10-13T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Marta,"Millie's place is a nice small studio, perfect for 1 person or a couple. It is in a nice neighbourhood, and very well communicated. The apartment was tidy and clean, with spare drawers and part of the closet, so you feel like home. The desk gives an extra space, very useful if you are staying for work. I will definitely stay again here next time I need a place in Sydney."
2017-10-19T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Bonnie,"A very welcoming place, and conveniently located."
2017-10-27T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Caroline,"Millie's place was fabulous! It's really central, close to public transport (trains, ferries and buses) and perfect for one or two people. It is cute as a button and super clean. Check in and out was really straight forward and she even provided coffee for her coffee machine. I highly recommend it!"
2017-10-31T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Ken,"Great place, close from the harbour and train!"

Millie is a thoughtful and generous host who was so easy to communicate with, and I would definitely stay here again."
2017-11-22T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Dena,Great location and great restaurants surrounding Millie’s place!
2017-11-30T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Jihwan,There was unpleasant gas smell in the house but Millie tried to solve the issue.
2017-12-02T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Jessica,great
2017-12-15T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Daniel,"Beautiful view, great central location with Milsons Point station just a few minutes walk away.Charming place that had everything that was needed to make the stay a very good experience!Communication with host was quick and easy, Millie seems like a lovely person.Would recommend! :)"
2017-12-18T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Alex,"Millie's apartment is really nice. It's neat and tidy, and while small, is well laid out and comfortable. The view from the balcony is quite pretty, as you can see the top of the Harbour Bridge."
2017-12-25T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Raffa,great Appartment:) we had an awesome stay :)
2018-01-04T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Paris,"We stayed at Millie's apartment for a few nights and can highly recommend it! It's in an excellent location (very close to public transport, cafes, supermarkets etc) with an equally excellent view out over the Harbour bridge. The apartment is very comfortable and great to come back to after a busy day exploring. A great place to stay!"
2018-01-11T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Keilagh,We had an amazing couple nights at Millie's.  The apt was absolutely perfect for what we needed and Millie was a very considerate host.  Would absolutely stay here again! And the views of the bridge are fab!
2018-01-21T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Karen,"Beautiful place with an amazing view over harbor bridge. Very clean, walking distance to the nearest train station or you can have a lovely walk to the Opera House. Millie was super helpful and provided many tips plus she made her own little guides at home you could read and use. Eveything was there and her beautiful place made me feel right at home!"
2018-01-27T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Jeffrey,"Great location, excellent kitchen. Bathroom could be improved but otherwise well worthwhile and fair value. Millie is a very good host."
2018-02-20T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Man,"房間設備充足,交通方便,房東很友善及樂於為住客解決問題"
2018-02-22T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Jessica,Great place! A wonderful space for two people even sharing the pull out bed. She has AppleTV which allowed my partner to log in and watch a movie we have downloaded. The views are amazing and it was such a short and beautiful walk across the bridge. There is also a cheap ferry that will get you across fast!
2018-02-24T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Kandise,"The unit is immaculately clean and tidy and in a fantastic location - just 8 minutes walk to the ferry at North Sydney or Milson's Point station in the other direction - or you can walk the bridge if the weather is nice.  The unit is small but we LOVED it, and I would definitely recommend it for a couple or two friends.  Millie was great with communication and access to the unit was easy.  Thanks Millie for making our stay so enjoyable and comfortable!"
2018-02-28T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Marta,"The apartment is a little gem in a great location, near the public transport to quickly arrive to the centre. It is a cosy apartment, very pleasant to stay and feel like home!"
2018-03-03T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Stacey,"Close to the city, easy check in, comfortable accomodation. Well contained studio."
2018-03-06T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,지은,"Close to CBD, very clean,very informative"
2018-03-10T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Melissa,"Lovely, clean and cosy space. Fantastic location. Millie was helpful and responsive and I absolutely loved spending time there"
2018-03-11T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Mei,"An inviting space in a central location. Millie's apartment was bright, airy and eclectic. With views of the city overlooking the harbour bridge, it was in close proximity to Kirribilli shops, Milsons Point Station and North Sydney wharf. Would definitely recommend for tourists seeking a base to explore Sydney or locals for a weekend away :)"
2018-03-17T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Helen,"Millie’s apartment was super clean & tidy and in a very convenient location too (you can take the train, bus or even walk to the CBD). The thoughtful provision of amenities and smooth check-in process ensured a lovely stay. Great neighbourhood, felt safe walking back in the evenings."
2018-03-25T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Tanya,"Lovely little apartment, close to the heart of the city. Walking distance to several attractions and located in a nice neighbourhood. Would highly recommend!"
2018-03-29T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Nico,"Everything was perfect! Super fast communication - easy check in and out - cosy - awesome view at harbour bridge from the balcony - clean - super equipped - cbd in walking distance over harbour bridge - and a good hot shower (best after 4 weeks in the camper!!!)Could not more recommend, one of the best Airbnb's we had so far:)"
2018-04-01T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Jess,Super quaint area and easily accessible by the train. We had a great time and the host was super nice. Would 10/10 stay again
2018-04-07T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Bret,"Millie's ""Shoebox"" would be great for one person or a couple looking for a value minded stay in Sydney with great view, clean accommodations, close to Milsons Point train station and even closer to the North Sydney ferry stop that takes you across the harbor to downtown Sydney and the Opera House.  You walk up the road a bit to North downtown and that's where you can buy all the groceries, beer and wine you need for your stay at a pretty good deal.  The views out the balcony are awesome - yes Millie's place is on the corner of a pretty busy stretch of street during commuter hours - but it adds to the charm; watching everyone scurry off to work while you're on holiday!  And the evening time was great for the balcony as you can open up the door, grab a glass of wine and enjoy the views of the Harbour Bridge at evening and sunset.  The bed was very comfortable for one, the kitchen was well stocked, the building itself seemed very safe and secure and it had a nice little counter w/ two bar stools that you can set up your IPad for the day/morning, have breakfast and get some work done before heading out onto your adventures.  You can tell I'm a big fan - as I'm an airbnb Superhost myself back in the USA.  The best part ... Millie's customer service and communication.  I cam a long way from SFO airport landing at 6:30 am after a long flight and Millie went out of her way to make sure I could either do an early check in or bag drop - and she was awesome during my visit with places to check out, etc.  She's a Superhost for a reason.  I've traveled around the world and have been to many countries and continents staying at various Airbnb units - Millie's was right up there for location, value, services, views and cleanliness.  Regards, Bret ~ 3ONE8 Manzanita in Manzanita, Oregon USA ~"
2018-04-12T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Erin,Millie's place is great. I have stayed here now 3 times. You can not beat yhe value and the locality
2018-04-21T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Phan,Clean and convenient. Millie is also quick to response to any of our enquiries. Highly recommended.
2018-05-26T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Joseph,"Clean, perfect location and an affable host.  What more to ask for!?"
2018-07-07T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Tom,"Millie was a great host and her apartment was perfect. It was clean, spacious and comfy. We had a little issue the first day when the electric tripped (the fuse box is in the wardrobe) but Millie’s friend Shelly and Millie were both so helpful and attentive it didn’t matter! The bed is super comfy and she has everything you could possibly need.The view from the balcony really is the same as the pictures- it’s incredible! I would highly recommend this apartment and wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again! Thank you Millie!"
2018-07-16T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Eleni,Everthing was perfect!
2018-08-01T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Cliff,Millie is very gracious
2018-08-24T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Susan,Location is great. Hassle free check in and Millie responded quickly to our questions.
2018-09-03T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Vanessa,"Millie’s place is very cute, clean and in a very good location. Plus the view is incredible! We had a wonderful stay and will definitely hope to stay at Millie’s again next time we visit Sydney. It really added to our experience ☺️"
2018-09-30T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Susan,This is the 2nd time we have stayed at Millie and it was great. Will stay again
2018-10-03T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Dylan,It’s really a good experience!
2018-10-18T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Rosie,Great location! The train station was only 10 mins away. Recommend this place for anyone who wants to explore the city for a reasonable price!
2018-10-20T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,彤,"公寓做饭的工具一应俱全,配料也是超级多,非常适合度假"
2018-10-24T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Yzella,"Millie’s apartment is perfect for a solo traveller like myself, or for a couple. The location is perfect, only a short train ride right into circular quay! The view from the balcony  overlooking harbour bridge while I ate my breakfast was something else! Millie responded to my messages super quickly and answered all my questions. Definitely recommend staying here and if I ever get the chance to go back to Sydney this is where I’d hope to stay!"
2018-10-26T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Hazel Joy,"Small, cozy, and very stylish place! Will definitely come back!"
2018-10-31T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Edith,"The appartment is very easy to reach by train or bus. It is not big but big enough (and cute) as you will be out most of the time to explore Sydney. Millie is very accurate with response, tries to help the best she can with all kind of tips. The elevator in the appartment building was most convenient with our heavy suitcases..... :). Thanks again Millie."
2018-11-08T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,James,"Millie's apartment is super cute and felt homely the moment I walked in the door. The views from the balcony are superb, a perfect place to spend an evening with a glass of wine. The apartment has a well equipped kitchen, there's good wifi and the bed is really comfy.I loved the location, just a few minutes walk from the station and the ferry (which was a great way to arrive in the city centre!), and you can easily walk or run to the north side of the harbour bridge and Luna Park. There's a few nice places to have coffee nearby (check out The Flying Bear) as well as amenities and a supermarket in North Sydney.  Crossing the harbour bridge or taking the ferry every day really added to my experience of Sydney.There was a little bit of traffic noise which was the only slight downside (the place would really benefit from double glazing) but I soon got used to it and everything else more than made up for it. I'd love to stay again one day - a real 5 star Airbnb experience.  Thanks Millie!"
2018-11-11T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,George,"Perfect place to stay for a few days to explore Sydney. Short walk to Milsons Point train station and stunning walk over the harbour bridge. Amazing balcony views, would highly recommend."
2018-11-14T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Laura,"Location was great, 10 min walk to train station. View of bridge: amazing. Size: think Manhattan or Tokyo. Bed: extremely comfortable. Quirky and older building/apartment with a few things that remind you its old, though not any pressing issues. Noise at night like any big city, but free parking and an elevator make up for it. However, (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps nor GPS took me to the correct address, so be prepared if you’re driving. Safe, and served the purpose. Recommend to a single or easygoing traveler!"
2018-11-18T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Vanessa,Cosy apartment conveniently located close to cafes and public transport. Millie was quick to respond and provided detailed instructions for our stay . Thanks Millie!
2018-11-26T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Nathalie,"Beau petit nid avec une superbe vue sur les immeubles et le pont de Sydney.  Quartier tranquille. À 5-10 minutes de marche du ferry ou de la station de train/métro Milsons Point. 30 minutes à pied de Circulay Quay. Quelques petites épiceries en sortant du métro dont 1 du côté de Luna park mais plus haut que la station de train. Parfait pour une personne seule et l'endroit est très sécuritaire. Bien équipé dont un french press et une machine expresso. Pas de cafetière mais une bouilloire. Beaucoup d'équipements pour faire la cuisine. Seul point incommodant est le bruit de la circulation et la luminosité dans la pièce la nuit. Donc, munissez vous de bouchons pour les oreilles et de cache yeux pour la nuit. Aucun bruit entendu des voisins ou du passage. Endroit propre et en ordre mais vieillot. Matelas et oreillers confortables."
2018-11-28T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Catherine,"Nicely furnished little apartment with everything you need for a stay. Great kitchen facilities and well kitted out. For those that do not like noise, this is not the best option as it is a noisy street."
2018-12-06T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Christopher,"The studio was great for us to stay. We love to stay in North Sydney and had the best stay in Millies studio with amazing bridge views. The studio is how it‘s described by Millie, for my wife and myself perfect to relax for a week. It‘s not to small as you will stay in it just for the night and in case of staying there for a longer time you can use the balcony with his amazing views.We used the Milsons Point train station, but more often the ferry terminals North Sydney and Milsons Point because of the short ways to Circular Quay and city. Shopping is possible in North Sydney supermarkets which are 10 minutes away.Millie answers very fast and is helpful in everything although there is (nearly) nothing that needs to be explained because of all the information Millie gives to you.Would definitively love it to stay again in Millies studio!Thank you again,cheers Chris"
2018-12-08T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Taylor,"Cutest apartment, perfect area, great amenities and a wonderfully helpful host. Can't recommend Millie enough."
2018-12-22T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Finuala,"I loved staying at Millie’s! The location is fantastic - walking distance to the station, the harbour, and a selection of cafes and shops. The views of the harbour bridge are great as well. The apartment is well equipped with everything you could need whilst you stay and Millie was very helpful in organising a check-in time and sharing other useful information about the place. I would happily stay here again."
2018-12-28T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Jason (Cheng-Hsiang),This place has fantastic location in a very nice neighborhood. Cute apartment and the host is easy to communicate with. Definitely recommend a stay here.
2019-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Brian,Great location ...... generally nice apartment ..... bathroom needs a refurb ........ behind settee/ bed needs vacuuming
2019-01-16T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Natalie,"I agree with positive things that were written in other reviews about the location, view from balcony (I was happy to see a friendly colorful bird visit), nice host with good communication skills and the wifi connection.  I also feel the bathroom should be remodeled."
2019-02-05T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Brad,"A great location for seeing the iconic sites of Sydney and the North Sydney beaches. After a 10 min walk to the trains, you can be in the CBD in 10 mins. From the airport to the apartment door was 50 minutes."
2019-02-09T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,진서,역이랑 엄청 가깝고 하버브릿지도 바로 앞에서 볼 수 있어서 매번 뷰 보고 감탄했네요~! 주택가라 조용하고 안전해서 다음에도 방문하고 싶습니당! I won’t say other words:)) Perfect!
2019-02-19T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Megan,"Millie’s place is absolutely amazing. One of a kind with beautiful views and walking distance to all transportations. Great place to stay, with cute little finishing touches. She even had a bottle of wine for us, with snacks and a jar of useful things you need while traveling. Definitely recommend staying here!"
2019-02-23T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Thomas Peter,"Eine kleine süße Unterkunft unweit der Brücke. Man kann problemlos in die City laufen und die tolle Aussicht genießen. Millie ist eine tolle Gastgeberin. Die Kommunikation klappte super, wir erhielten fast sofort eine Rückmeldung. Alles war so wie beschrieben. Der Wein im Kühlschrank war eine nette Begrüßung.Die Straße ist etwas laut aber nachts wird es ruhiger. Für eine oder zwei Personen ist die kleine Wohnung angenehm für ein paar Tage in der Stadt."
2019-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Elaine,"Millie’s places is a gem, you feel like you’re part of neighborhood in no time. It’s clean and cosy. Millie is very thoughtful giving all kinds of good suggestions. I highly recommend this place in North Sydney in a lovely section of Sydney close to ferries and trains."
2016-12-04T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,Eva,"We had a great stay at the apartment. It is located in a beautiful spot, ten minutes walking distance to Paradise Beach. Fully equipped. Molly was very helpful and made our stay so easy. Totally recommendable.  "
2016-12-11T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,Emma,We had a lovely stay at this very unique property that is set in a beautiful bushland setting. It is great for anyone wanting to feel immersed in nature but still have the beach and shops just a few minutes away. The design of the home is amazing - with huge windows and all natural materials throughout. Molly was lovely to deal with and made communication easy. Would definitely love to stay again!
2017-01-18T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,Ekaterina Sergeevna,"Awesome! Better than the pictures. Secluded, cozy place. Thank you very much for the warm welcome. We will definitely back again"
2017-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,Alexander,Great place to stay for a relaxing weekend up at the northern beaches. Thanks to Molly and our hosts for a pleasant stay.
2017-02-11T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,Michelle,Great stay for a weekend away! Molly was fantastic with regards to communication. She was very flexible with our stay and organised in house massages for us which were fantastic as we didn't have to go anywhere. This place is great for a quiet and relaxing weekend. Thanks again!
2017-02-17T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,Diane,Wake up to the kookaburra's in this bush surrounded apartment. Would be good for those who seek the recycled look and feel.  Access not suitable for small children or us (70yo). Nice area and excellent check in communication and service. Caring owner was concerned for our car in hail storm and moved it to neighbours garage.
2017-04-09T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,Kelsey,"Secluded spot in the trees, steep access, small but comfortable, nice bathroom, a lovely quiet weekender. "
2017-04-13T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,Brooke,Great value for money. Great area to visit. Hosts were very attentive.
2017-04-15T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,Nick,"Lovely place, beautifully furnished and set amongst the trees. Effortless check-in and great experience overall. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
2017-04-19T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,怀玉,My friends and I are totally enjoying a great time at the house. It is super nice with the trees all around~ enjoy one night stay at the lovely house
2017-04-22T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,Amy,The location of this accommodation was perfect for our needs and felt very tranquil amongst the trees however future guests should note phone reception is limited! Future guests should also note that the hot and cold taps on the shower are labelled wrong - we didn't find this out until it was too late as due to the lack of phone service we couldn't call anyone to help. We were 100% impressed with this accommodation but it did serve our needs for the night.
2017-05-28T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,Tash,"A lovely little home tucked in the bush. This is one place in a battle axe street, meaning there are a couple of houses nestled into a hill in the bush. We stayed within the Avalon beach area, which is literally a three minute drive from the accomodation. There's a fantastic French restaurant and bakery close by and the breath-taking beach with a little ocean pool where you can do laps to burn off the croissants.The house is well-stocked with tea, vegemite, pots, pans etc. Beds were comfortable and there were bathrobes to strut around in.  We went at the start of winter and the place had enough heaters to keep it cosy. "
2017-06-11T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,Ishani,Everything was absolutely beautiful. Self check-in was perfect for our circumstances. The treehouse was idyllic and all of the amenities were beautiful. Communication with the host was outstanding. Would stay here again!
2017-06-16T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,Josi,We didn't actually stay here but we used this gorgeous property for a photoshoot. Molly was super helpful and made sure we could start our shoot on time. The property was super clean and exactly as the pictures showed! Great little retreat in Avalon.
2017-07-10T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,Cameron,Very serviceable accomodation. Great area.
2017-08-13T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,Karina,"A beautiful place for a weekend getaway. Great communication, close to the shops and beach and really comfy beds! Molly was really accommodating as well, thank you!"
2017-08-20T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,Hena,Great place for a quiet getaway
2017-09-16T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,Danielle,"The apartment was perfect for our overnight stay. Communication was excellent throughout, and place was in a great spot - not even five minutes drive from Avalon shops and the beach. Beds were really comfy, the apartment was equipped with everything we needed, and it was so lovely waking up surrounded by the bush. Would definitely stay again!"
2017-09-25T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,Jace,"Nice place for living, quiet and peaceful"
2017-10-01T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,Ellie,A lovely place to relax. Very charming!
2017-11-05T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,Edward,"This is an amazing place to escape the bustle of Sydney. Comfortable, and close to everything you'd need and nestled in beautiful canopy. Highly recommend."
2017-11-18T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,Samuel,"Gorgeous space, perfect for an escape from the city. Would recommend to anyone looking a place within range of quiet but also cafes and things to do."
2017-12-08T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,Kate,"Beautifully located private apartment in bush setting in Avalon. We stayed for a wedding in Whale Beach and the apartment was perfect for our family. Hosts were very helpful and great with communication during our stay and beforehand. Access to the apartment is via a very steep driveway and stairs which were slippery in the wet so be careful if raining. If parking more than one car parking is on the road which is at the bottom of the steep driveway but there is one spot very close to the apartment which was handy. Beds very comfy, apartment nicely styled and bathroom lovely with a clear roof and lovely toiletries which was a nice touch. Perfect for our stay. Photos are accurate representation of apartment."
2017-12-09T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,Hannah,"Fantastic apartment in a fabulous location. Beware there are no fly screens on any window and given the location in the bush, with a pond outside one main window, mosquitoes were fierce. It was also disappointing that there was no hot water."
2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,Margherita,"I enjoyed my stay at the Avalon apartment amongst the trees, check in and check out was smooth, and communication overall was appreciated. The location was great and especially for the summer time of year. The only critique was the front door and maybe being a bit sturdier, and that the surrounding area was a lot busier than anticipated however it was still a lovely stay."
2018-01-20T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,Mark,"The location is very handy to the beaches and local restaurants, and is also very quiet.  There are some nice touches to the design of the property that add to the experience - the skylights, large sliding timber windows, wrap around verandah, and an outside shower for washing the sand off after a trip to the beach.  The facilities are comprehensive and the beds comfortable.  Suited our family very nicely for our weekend at the beach.  A ceiling fan in the main living area would be an easy and inexpensive way to improve comfort on hot nights, but all in all it is a lovely place to stay."
2018-01-21T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,Renata,We went to do a photoshoot on the property. It was very beautiful and the hosts did everything they could to ensure we would have a great time. :) thanks guys.
2018-02-03T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,Mandy,Very nice outlook however a little on the old side.
2018-03-17T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,Nhi,"I stayed here for a birthday weekend getaway. It was my first experience with Airbnb which went smoothly. The communication was timely and helpful throughout the stay. The phone reception /wifi was a bit patchy & there were a few creepy-crawlies which kept my friends up for a portion of the night (didn’t really bother me). Otherwise, we had a relaxing time; the space is cosy and beautiful as pictured, well-equipped, with comfy beds, in a peaceful location. We also enjoyed visiting the cafes and beaches nearby."
2018-03-25T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,Kathryn,Very cool accommodation set amongst the tree-tops
2018-04-02T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,Alex,Billie and Molly have a great apartment with a cosy feel. Located in a very quiet spot and only 5 min drive from Avalon beach. Close to the shops and everything you need. Thanks for having us! Alex & Jo
2018-04-23T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,Adam,Great little 'treehouse' and not too far from the main town. Lovely little beach just a short walk away too to go and watch the sunset.
2018-07-15T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,Cat & Will,"Lovely little place for a quick trip away, concierge were brilliant "
2018-08-05T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,Jess,Amazing place :)
2018-09-02T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,Imogen,"Easy and friendly communication throughout our stay here. Place was cute and although surrounded by other houses it was nestled amongst trees so it was quite secluded. A rustic but well maintained 1 bedroom cottage well prepared for airbnb guests. About a 20 minute walk to Avalon beach and local shops, restaurants etc. Very steep driveway :)"
2018-09-16T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,Emma,"The location was great for our overnight trip visiting Palm Beach and surrounding areas. The bathroom with it’s clear roof gave amazing light and was a nice novelty.  The house had more of an older cabin type vibe, although the bathroom was really modern and white and clean. Check in was really easy with the lock box and we booked the day of and got a response within the hour. Great service."
2018-10-01T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,Laura,"Our stay was absolutely perfect! The service was excellent to communicate with and flexible with us. The space was beautiful, clean and private. We loved spending time in the afternoon sun that streams into the house. The space is beautifully decorated and had everything we needed. Thanks so much- we hope to be back!"
2018-11-28T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,Andre,"Beautiful space, easy check in, Molly quick to communicate.Would return"
2018-12-01T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,Jessica,"The location is nice and close to Avalon, but it is a  pretty small place and wouldn't recommend it for 4 adults as it only has one bedroom and two single beds in the living room (not as pictured). The photos make it look nicer than it is, it's dark and pretty run down and there were a fair few bugs inside. The place is private which was nice and very green."
2018-12-01T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,Melodie,"Cushie was great. Good communication. The place is not the same as in photos. The place was not very well cleaned and the furnitures were old, from the 70s. The location is amazing though - real disconnection from the city. I would not recommend this place if you are after a bit of comfort. Ideal for a yoga retreat."
2018-12-15T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,Emma,Lovely stay in a unique little spot
2018-12-25T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,Lily,Great location and space amongst the forest but so close to town! Easy check in - thanks!
2019-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,Libby,A truly unique and homely place for a holiday - somewhat small but aesthetically very beautiful inside and out. Convenient to many facilities including Clareville. Just remember to use a lot of insect repellant in the summer.
2019-01-24T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,Kimiko,"Loved this place amongst the trees. Felt like we were up in the mountains in Bali. Had everything we needed and the place has some lovely warm touches. If you’re scared of creepy crawlies it may not be your best option, but we loved it nonetheless. Hosts were really responsive and helpful. Would definitely come back here if we are looking for a quick getaway from Sydney by the beach."
2019-01-27T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,Rachel,Lovely unit- quiet and clean. Good place to stay to explore the northern beaches from. Had a great stay here and was easy to arrange how to access the place. Thanks for the great weekend!
2019-02-09T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,Natascha,"This is the second time we’ve stayed at this lovely, leafy, private spot. We love how close it is to everything, yet nestled in the trees it feels like miles from the hustle of Sydney life."
2019-02-16T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,James,"Beautiful home, thank you!"
2015-12-30T05:00:00.000Z,9612902,Linda,Beautiful house and gorgeous pool and spa! Perfect for our family with young kids
2016-01-06T05:00:00.000Z,9612902,Jessica,"Heidi's home was perfect. Our family group was very comfortable and had a wonderful time. Heidi was very accomodating, the house was clean and everything we needed. The kids loved playing in the pool and the adults loved having a spa when the kids went to bed! It was a great location and home base for sightseeing. We'd definitely stay again! Thanks for having us and helping make our family reunion so wonderful, "
2016-01-07T05:00:00.000Z,9612902,Grag,The host canceled this reservation 30 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2016-01-11T05:00:00.000Z,9612902,Penelope,"All is as described. Lovely home, not just a house. We were made to feel completely welcome. Our stay in Sydney at Heidi's home was like coming back to an oasis. Thank you for your hospitality. "
2016-01-17T05:00:00.000Z,9612902,James,"Beautiful house - the photos do not do it justice, and Heidi was absolutely lovely to deal with and was ready to help with any issues that arose during our stay, literally coming to the house in the rain to fix the spa!A lovely weekend overall, in a lovely house with a lovely owner. Would definitely stay again."
2016-02-20T05:00:00.000Z,9612902,Van,Our family has such a wonderful time living in Heidi's house. We have 7 adults and 1 baby and this house comfortably accommodates all. It is a very nice house with every convenient facility you could ask for a holiday rental. Heidi even got a rice cooker and so many spices that we use for our cooking. It's so great because my family is from Vietnam and they love to cook and cannot live without rice. We also have great time using the clean pool and barbecue. My husband and I had a good experience when taking my 5 month baby to swim for the first time. Heidi is a fantastic host that welcomed us in the first day and showed us every corner of the house. We are very satisfied and definitely will come back here if we have a chance
2016-03-09T05:00:00.000Z,9612902,Catherine,"This house is absolutely stunning. We were in town for a family funeral, and I'm so glad we found Heidi and her house as it made our stay a lot easier to deal with.The house and property are gorgeous, a lot of effort has gone into how it looks. There's everything you can think of here and is perfect for families. It's perfect for anyone really. Our toddler was in heaven and I suspect a bit sad to come home.The linen felt and smelt new and incredibly fresh, the instructions Heidi left described everything well. The air conditioning, netflix and internet were all terrific. Having three bathrooms and toilets was a blessing with our large family. The pool, yard, trampoline, cubby house, swings and hammocks all got used a lot.Heidi was incredibly accommodating, she let us stay at really short notice and did her very best to make our stay as comfortable as it could be given our circumstances.This stay was worth every cent and not only will we recommend the house but we'll also stay again should the need arise.Thank you Heidi."
2016-03-15T04:00:00.000Z,9612902,Belinda,Heidi was very pleasant to deal with and provided me the flexibility I needed when it came to a late checkout. The large beautiful home was extremely comfortable and very well equipped to suit my large family's needs. Her backyard was manicured abc the pool was super clean. 
2016-03-26T04:00:00.000Z,9612902,Erin,This was booked on behalf of my colleagues and they really enjoyed their stay. Thanks Heidi
2016-04-02T04:00:00.000Z,9612902,Kevin,"Heidi welcomed our family in person at the house. She gave us a nice tour and made sure we were comfortable using all the controls for the pool, appliances, TV's ect. She then sat with us and reviewed our itinerary for the week. She had some great suggestions that we would have never known about that really made our visit to Sydney special.The house has been updated but still has the charm of an older home with the crown molding and tray ceilings. The kids had a great time in the Pool and jumping on the trampoline.The neighborhood was quiet and provided easy access to the train as well as shopping and restaurants.Our family thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Heidi's property and would recommend it with no reservations."
2016-04-11T04:00:00.000Z,9612902,Nicole,"We had a fantastic family reunion trip staying at Heidi's home. She was extremely accommodating letting us stay at the last minute and also letting us extend our check-out when some family members took ill. Heidi has a very welcoming and comfortable house which is obviously a well-loved family home. The pool and back garden were amazing. Towels, linen and all appliances etc. were all in great condition. We really couldn't have asked for any more! Thank you so much, Heidi"
2016-04-18T04:00:00.000Z,9612902,Kim,"Thanks Heidi,Awesome property! Our family had a lovely time. We had a gorgeous family bbq on sunday where my children and nephew ran around in the 'park' as my nephew called it. We all enjoyed the pool & spa - even our bubbly black lab! Beds super comfy & delightfully decorated. To top it all off - very quite neighbourhood close to all amenities. Thanks Heidi & family for sharing your fab home."
2016-05-08T04:00:00.000Z,9612902,Judith,"There are no words to describe how perfect this property was for our needs and for how amazing Heidi was in accommodating our request. Heidi bent over backwards to make the property available to us even though it meant she and her family had to change their plans to vacate the property. The location and size of the house plus all the extras were a perfect fit for us. We needed a place where family could come together - from Spain, Bangladesh, Melbourne, Albury, Gundaroo and Canberra - for a funeral and Heidi's place was like coming home. On the one night when everyone was staying over, the house easily slept 9 adults and 3 children. It was great having access to 3 bathrooms. Off road parking and great relaxing options both inside and outside. The pool and spa and trampoline and cubby house were the icing on the cake. Thank you a million times over for your generosity Heidi - it made a world of difference to all of us. "
2016-10-30T04:00:00.000Z,9612902,Luke,Heidi's place was absolutely amazing. The house was immaculate with plenty of space for the 3 other couples we had staying with us. The house itself had everything you could possibly want for a weekend in Sydney.The location was absolutely incredible close to Carlton train station and not to far from the Airport.A big backyard with plenty of space for kids to run around an amazing pool which was incredible. I will be recommending Heidi's place to all my family and friends and will not hesitate to contact Heidi for any further trips to Sydney to see if her place is available.   
2016-11-08T05:00:00.000Z,9612902,Henry,"The most amazing host and home I have ever had the pleasure of visiting! We used Heidis lovely home for a film shoot and could not have found a more idillic location. The entire crew wanted throughout the day to jump in the pool and go for a swim it was that inviting.Heidi is also the perfect host, nothing is too hard or can't be done, she even sourced another dining room table for us!I would recommend Heidi and hour home to anyone who would listen. Now I want to go back and stay there with my family!"
2016-11-14T05:00:00.000Z,9612902,Ying,Heidi's house is clean and comfortable. My kids loves her back garden very much. It's a mini playground for them. It's easy to reach the shopping center and airport. We enjoyed every minutes here in her house.
2016-12-10T05:00:00.000Z,9612902,Kelly,"We loved our stay at this delightful house. The house was perfect for our family holiday of 3 couples and 5 children. The backyard space and amenities were so well suited to our needs, our children happily played outside every waking hour. The kitchen is well equipped, with indoor and outdoor dining options. The bathrooms were modern and lovely. The bedrooms were clean and comfortable and spacious for those needing a portacot. Heidi is a lovely, accommodating and well organised host and made our stay very comfortable and easy. We will most definitely rebook here in the future. "
2016-12-27T05:00:00.000Z,9612902,Taqi,The place is amazing.  Great location for morning walks. Very friendly neighbourhood. The house is very clean and the swimming pool is just way too relaxing. I honestly enjoyed my stay for 5 nights. The place is very spacious and I could not look for any place better than this.
2017-01-22T05:00:00.000Z,9612902,Dan,"Great house with all the inclusions you could ask for. Very comfortable, private and quiet neighbourhood . Very central and easy to get into the city or to the south. We stayed for two weeks with our three young children and it met our needs perfectly. Will definately recommend."
2017-01-29T05:00:00.000Z,9612902,Zulfiqar Ali Khan,this home was big and very spacius.can easly stay upto 8 peoples.pool was plus and childrreb likes it.home have enough aminties and OK wifi.bugs and flies are only downside but it  its ok if you are not staying long in kitchen.

Comfortable beds and good linens. Bathrooms are lovely. Would recommend for a family trip and would stay again. Thanks Heidi!"

2018-11-28T05:00:00.000Z,9612902,Alex,Heidi was a fantastic host. Communication was fast. clear and easy and the house was great. Highly recommended for families and groups.
2019-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,9612902,Tracy & Eddie,"My family had a wonderful time thank you for your sharing your home with us Heidi . Everything was there that we wanted in a holiday home, Although it would  of been nice to have a second fridge and little more shade for around the pool. Highly recommended"
2019-01-06T05:00:00.000Z,9612902,Judith,"Our family group stayed at Heidi's back in 2016 and we all loved it. One of the kids, aged 8, who has travelled the world and stayed in many fabulous places, declared ""Oh, I LOVE that house"" when he heard we were returning this year. And once again it lived up to his expectations and surpassed ours. The five bedrooms are stunning and the mattresses to die for on the comfort front. The three bathrooms are the epitome of luxury - they have all been completely made over since our last visit and are both beautiful and functional. The pool, the spa, the cubby house, the hammocks, the undercover outdoor area ... the list of features goes on.

Cafes, top restaurants at your doorstep, it is a foodies dream! Very handy transport links with buses outside door  and train station only 7 min walk away. We also loved access to the outdoor pool to cool off in after a day out and about.  Victoria was great to deal with- prompt and reliable with communication and very welcoming. I have high expectations  for accomodation and this ticked all the boxes. Certainly would like to return if ever back in Sydney.  Thanks Vickie.  "

Also has a supermarket exactly opposite so extremely convenient. Vickie kept in touch with us and arranged to have the internet fixed very quickly when it failed even though she was not in Sydney at the time."

The apartment was beautifully well kept and the location was perfect - quaint locale with convenient shops, cafes and restaurants a stone's throw away without having that crowded or city-like feel.

Easy walking distance to many sights such as museums, St. Mary's Cathedral as well as a nearby harbor with restaurants to enjoy breakfast or lunch.  The room is near a very lively part of Sydney but not so close as to be inconveniencing. Overall, I enjoyed my stay and would return again in the future. "

Not suitable for cooking since the smell will stay in the studio, so we ate mostly around the neighbourhood which was perfectly fine with us since there are so many food options."

The location is in a lovely area with several nice cafes and restaurants only a short walk away.  There's also a supermarket across the road which is so handy. The outlook from the window was delightful - warm sun, beautiful trees and great to just watch people strolling by!  Victoria is very friendly and helpful (thank you!) and provided us with tips on where to eat and visit -  including the market near the El Alamein Fountain on Saturday morning.  You won't be disappointed."

We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
2017-09-20T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Libby,"We had 4 wonderful nights  at Vickie's apartment.  She met us there, showed us around the apartment and recommended several restaurants you can see on the street below.  The view and location is terrific.  It is an easy 5 minute walk to the train station.  The towels and bedding were top notch.  We made use of the chromecast for streaming tv shows.   The indoor plants are a great touch, very impressed to see a healthy fiddle leaf fig, I should have asked Vickie for tips.  There is nowhere to hang clothes up but when I travel I usually just live out of the suitcase anyway.  Definitely recommend staying here!"
2017-09-24T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Riccardo,"Small studio in nice building in one of the best parts of Sydney, close to many good restaurants and bars, not to mention several shops, walking distance (20/30 mins) to the CBD and very good connections with public transportation.

In the perfect location if you are looking to explore the city, kings cross station is just a 10 minute walk away. The streets surrounding he apartment are full of small business shops and there is a convenience store right across the road. We would definitely rebook if we were travelling here again. Unfortunately we didn’t get a chance to meet Victoria, due to our arrival time. However she responded fast to messages and was very helpful."

2017-12-16T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Michael,"Victoria’s place is in a great location. There are plenty of eating places nearby and lots of interesting shops. All of Sydney’s attractions are within walking distance but public transport is good, we got buses into town and got the train and bus to Bondi Beach. We loved having breakfast looking out of the window at the passers by in the street. Great place!"
2017-12-21T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Susie,We had a brilliant time exploring Sydney from Vickie’s apartment

2018-01-08T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,John,"The apartment is ideally situated for public transport to all of the major attractions. Equally, many places of interest are only a pleasant stroll away. Vickie is an excellent host who fully informed us about the apartment and the locality on arrival. Lots of good local restaurants and a supermarket is just across the road. A great stay and we highly recommend this apartment."
2018-01-10T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Carole,I booked Victoria’s place for my parents to stay while they were visiting Syndey for two nights. They had a great trip and loved Victoria’s place. I knew it would be perfect for them as they aren’t well travelled and didn’t know Sydney at all. Victoria was the perfect and host and checked them in early and helped with anything they needed. If I make it to Sydney I will definitely be checking this place for availability. Thanks again Vickie!
2018-01-14T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Klaus,"Very nice apartment, perfect location in a beautiful neighbourhood, Vickie is a super-nice host."

2018-01-26T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Garth,"Thanks for the fantastic accomodation Vickie. Very clean and loved the personal touches, such as welcome chocolates and the fridge stocked with  milk, water, etc. The location was perfect, with everything being within a short walking distance. The flat was very quiet too which was surprising.  Vickie was the perfect host and very good at communication. Thanks again!"
2018-02-01T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Leroy,"Die Lage fand ich gut, man ist innert 10 minuten beim Bahnhof Kings Cross und es hat viele kleine Imbisse etc. in der nähe. Direkt vis-a-vis befindet sich auch ein Supermarkt was ich cool finde. Die Unterkunft was sehr sauber und sah aus wie beschrieben. Das einzige das ich bemängeln kann ist die klimaanlage welche anfangs auf unser Bett getropft hat, und auf den Bildern sah die Unterkunft um einiges grösser aus als sie tatsächlich war. Gut fotografiert ;-)"
2018-02-03T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Rebecca,"We really loved this space, such a great location in lovely affluent Pott’s point with great transport links as well as a nice walk to circular Quay through the botanical gardens. Smart building and v clean, quiet. Vickie was very accommodating and a lovely host. Visit the farmers market just up the road on Saturday mornings. Great supermarket directly opposite."
2018-02-07T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Karla,"This studio is clean and just as described! Vickie went above and beyond to meet us and had all the basic necessities ready to go. The unit is centrally located in a great neighborhood. My husband and I walked and used public transportation all over Sydney. Look no further for a great place to stay! Thank you, Vickie for having us!"
2018-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Loreta,"Lovely stay! The apartment was great, easy to find and get the keys. The location was great with a grocery store and cafe right across the street. The apartment had everything I needed, very comfortable stay."
2018-02-18T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Gen,"We loved the location of Vickie’s apartment. The area was so quaint with many great cafes in short walking distance and the supermarket just across the street. The bus and train provided us easy access around and the walk to the Opera House and Harbor Bridge through the Royal Botanical Gardens was beautiful, though a bit long. It was relaxing to sit at the bar top and look out at the tree-lined street below or further out to the CBD skyline.  We did find the apartment a bit tight when walking from the main living area to the entry hall where the mini fridge is with the bed lowered, so we probably should’ve raised it when not in use. When I slept I could sometimes feel the the bed frame through the mattress, so I think maybe a memory foam mattress might work a bit better, I’m not sure.  There is a step up/down getting in and out of the shower with somewhat reduced headroom which won’t affect most people but could if someone had limited mobility or was very tall.  The walls were thin but the neighbors were all quiet in the evenings.  Vickie was so sweet to provide coffee, tea, water, muesli, and milk, and she provided us great tips and recommendations on places to go and how to get there! Vickie is truly a superstar host and you’ll be in great hands with her!!!"
2018-02-21T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Dai,Cozy and clean!Great!Near to the supermarket
2018-02-22T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Monique,Vickie's apartment was perfect for a 1 night stay in town. The location is so central and although the room is small it offers great value. The double glazing on the windows meant that we had a great sleep.Many thanks again Vickie for a seamless checkin.

2018-03-18T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Nicole,Victoria's apartment is in a great location. We enjoyed the Saturday market followed by a nice walk to the Royal Botanic Gardens and harbor.  Dinner downstairs at Billy Kwong was delicious. Victoria is quick to respond to questions and provides helpful suggestions for exploring the neighborhood.
2018-03-21T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Joseph,"We had a great stay with Vickie. Check in was easy and she was very contactable and helpful throughout.  Tea and coffee making facilities appreciated.Fold down bed was very comfy and made the most of the space within the room.  Also very stylishly decorates and (Hidden by Airbnb) TV was a great addition for watching Netflix.Location was great, only a short walk to Kings cross station and loads of cool cafes close by.  Also worth noting is a shuttle to airport run by the hotel for only 14 dollars !!We would happily stay there again."
2018-03-22T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Blair,Victoria's place was spotlessly clean. I also enjoyed the real bed sheets (not just a doona like you get in many AirBnb's.) Mcleay St is a great spot for food and shops also.
2018-03-28T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Janet,"This was our first AirBNB experience, so have nothing to compare it to, however, Vickie was very accommodating and we appreciated all the thoughtful touches in the apartment.  The apartment was small (as stated it is a studio - one room and a bathroom), but perfectly suitable for a couple as a base to explore the immediate area. The Kings Cross underground is within a 5 minute walk for locations further afield.  There were a couple of minor things that needed to be fixed for future guests (towel rail and shower head in bathroom), but Vickie said she would get these arranged after we left.  They did not affect our experience in any way, which was very pleasurable."
2018-04-25T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Patty,"We had a great stay at Victoria’s apartment! We were in Sydney for almost a month as our daughter had just had her first baby and the apartment was perfect for a number of reasons. It was in the perfect location being only a 5 min walk to her place as well as the best street in Potts Point! Just one block away were our favorite places to eat on Challis Street.... Fratell’s, The Fish Shop and Fejays.  Across the street is a great grocery store ... Woolworths.Every Saturday is a wonderful open Market up the street with the best corn fritters I’ve ever had and more. The Kings Cross train station is only 5 min away as well, which made getting around super easy.Her apartment was very clean, bright and comfortable. For being a studio we were a little concerned it may feel cramped for a month stay, but it never felt that way and a lot of that had to do with the the wall of windows that had a great view overlooking the trees and the city.The shower was a little tricky as it was small and you had to step up to get into it, so we bought a small shower mat and that did the trick so there was no more fear of slipping! Victoria has really thought everything thru as far as utilizing her space for the best efficiency and added great touches with all the amenities.We will look forward to staying there again on our next visit to see our daughter and family!"
2018-04-30T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Maj Lyhne,"Hun var så betænksom. Alt var perfekt, og hun svarede super hurtigt, hvis man havde spørgsmål. Intet at sætte en finger på"
2018-05-04T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Emily,"Victoria’s place is in the most wonderfully hip neighbourhood, with a location that allows one to walk to the iconic landmarks in Sydney. The loft is decorated in an extremely aesthetically pleasing manner, and her hospitality makes you feel at ease."
2018-05-06T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Rebecca,Exactly as described! We were very happy with our three nights at Victoria’s place. Some great eats within walking distance and close to public transport if you want to go somewhere else.Everything you need for a short stay!
2018-05-09T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Mike,This place is in a great spot. Convenient if you like to be close to restaurants and bars. Communication was very quick and clear.
2018-05-10T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Jason,Enjoyed me stay. Great location.
2018-05-12T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Katelin,Very cosy apartment! Perfect for one or two people for trips! Victoria was a great host and made it super easy to get in contact with!
2018-05-18T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Jo,Great studio apartment in fantastic location.  Very clean with extra touches and everything you needed.  Check in and out was very easy with good communication.  Would definitely stay again.
2018-05-20T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Marg,"Victoria’s apartment was excellent! Sparkling clean, comfortable, well-appointed and well-located. Although public transport is close by, if you’re prepared to walk a bit, you can easily reach the Gallery of NSW, walk through the Botanical Gardens and on to the Opera House and Circular Quay in about 40 minutes, enjoying the scenery!"
2018-05-30T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Helena,"Perfect location, the bus to CBD is less than 5 min walk away. The place is clean and cozy. I would go back!"
2018-06-03T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Chip,great location. really nice walk to the harbour area. place was a great base in-between all the activities we did in Sydney. nice and Central and easy to access. Woolworths across the road was great and the restaurants around the area were incredible.
2018-06-10T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Erika,"Victoria has been an amazing host. Her place is fully equipped with everything, cozy, great location and most importantly clean! Will definitely stay at Victoria's again when we visit Sydney!"
2018-06-12T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Rebecca,"Great location, snug and clean apartment with a very comfy bed. Close to the train station, beautiful walks nearby and heaps of cafes and restaurants on the surrounding streets. Loved our stay here at Victoria’s! "
2018-06-16T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Benaiah,Great Studio for relaxing and unwinding. Everything good that’s local is right at your doorstep.
2018-06-18T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Eirene,"The studio apartment was what we expected and exactly enough for two people, the bathroom though was kinda small. The television was connected to Chrome Cast so I enjoyed that. The location was near the bus stop and a 10-15 minute walk from the train station which is King's Cross. If you're a tourist, you'll probably want to walk around the city center, which is Town Hall (two stops from King's Cross Station). It is very convenient."
2018-06-23T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Valiha,Victoria's place is ideally situated.  It has absolutely everything you may need and the supermarket and shops along the road are super handy!  Victoria is great at maintaining communication and is very accommodating.  We had a super stay and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.  Be sure to check out the local market at the square with the fountain if you are there on a Saturday.
2018-06-26T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Jacky,My sister and I had a wonderful stay at Victoria's place! It was in a quiet area that was a quick walk or Uber ride to wherever we were headed. The place was clean and check in was easy. We we're able to make breakfast each morning with the provided amenities. The apartment was perfect for our 3 day stay.
2018-06-30T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Tobias,"Long story short, with no doubt a five star place. Great location, quiet, clean, store literally across the street... perfect. Will be back!"

2018-07-09T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Ella,"Vickie went absolutely above and beyond to make our stay as perfect as possible - offering early check in and also offering us to leave our luggage in the apartment after check out so we could continue to explore Sydney!The apartment itself is simple, in a great location and included everything that was needed for a comfortable, enjoyable stay. The addition of the chocolates, Sydney travel tips as well as local eateries etc was great. Would definitely recommend this apartment and will be back to stay when we next go to Sydney."
2018-07-13T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Marcus,Vickie’s apartment is exactly as the photos show! It is a fantastic place. Big room and really good sunlight coming into the apartment. The bed was comfortable and I liked that the showers had really hot water! There is a woolsworth just opposite the apartment! Will not hesitate staying at this place again when I’m in Sydney!
2018-07-18T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Ayen,"Highly recommended! Convenient location, beautiful place, hospitable host!  "

2018-08-05T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Misona,"멋진 뷰를 가진 곳입니다. 호스트도 굉장히 친절하셔서,다음번에 시드니가게더면 또 머물고싶어요.시드니 시내에서 조금 멀까봐 걱정했는데city hall역에서 지하철 두 정거장에,중심가 가는 버스도 정말로 숙소코앞에 있어서 불편함을 전혀 느끼지 못했어요.metro라는 큰 마트도 30초 거리에 있어서 아주아주 편했답니다. (Hidden by Airbnb) cast도 있어서 휴대폰이랑 TV연결해서 넷플리스, 유투브 등등 볼 수 있어요.정말 좋은 숙소였습니당!"
2018-08-24T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Kathleen,AMAZING! The apartment made my trip to Sydney- such a chic space in an awesome neighborhood. Am already planning my trip back!
2018-08-26T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Jo,This is a lovely little apartment in a great area.  Benefits are being close to Kings Cross train station so you can train straight from the airport changing at Central. You can walk into the city through the gardens.  Having a supermarket across the road is great too. Highly recommend this place.
2018-08-28T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Angela,"Great location, really clean, funky apartment. Good for one or two travellers. Generous supplies and easy communication. Highly recommended!"

2018-09-23T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Wallace,A great place to stay in Sydney.
2018-09-28T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Alston,"Victoria's apartment was perfect for us.  We enjoyed the area for its cleanliness, restaurants and cafés.  The convenience to the train after a busy day to come ""home"" was very nice.   An easy walk to central city was our daily preference. Victoria's apartment is well equipped and clean.   Everyday we were pleased to wake up there.  We would definitely return to Victoria's Chic City Pad with leafy outlook.Thanks Victoria for offering  your apartment to others, especially to us!! Bruce and Alston Johnson from Virginia, USA"
2018-10-02T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Miguel,Great location!
2018-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,婷婷,"房东很贴心,提前几天提供了入住指南而且很清晰,能够方便自助入住｡房间干净整洁,还贴心准备了牛奶果汁巧克力,还有健康的麦片和不健康的泡面,非常全面｡房子距离最近的火车站十分钟,公交站就在楼下,不过悉尼公交经常延误｡房子对面有超市和药店很方便,附近有邮局,沿路很多吃东西的地方｡总体非常好,值得再次入住｡"
2018-10-09T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Moritz,"Nice little place for a short Stay, food for breakfast including coffee was provided and the area is great as you have nice cafes and Restaurants close."
2018-10-12T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Agu,"El apartamento de Victoria es genial! La ubicación es excelente, muy cerca del centro y de la estación King Cross. El barrio es bellísimo! Estaba super completo, con todo lo que podría necesitar, tanto en la cocina como en el baño..... muy recomendable!!!! Lo volvería a elegir!!"
2018-10-16T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,James,"Amazing apartment in a lovely part of Sydney. The apartment has everything you need during your stay and more. Victoria was a fantastic host and I wouldn't hesitate to stay again. A 20 minute walk via the botanical gardens to the opera house, makes it ideal for exploring the city!"
2018-10-26T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Alison,We had a great stay at Vickie’s apartment. The location is central and there are plenty of nice places to eat and also a supermarket across the road. Vickie was very helpful in messages as unfortunately we didn’t get a chance to meet. I would definitely stay again!
2018-10-29T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Craig,"This apartment was perfect. Its a great location with easy access to transport around Sydney and most places are within walking distance. The local area surrounding the apartment is very nice, with lots of restaurants, bars and shops.The apartment was very clean and ideal for us as a couple. Check in was straight forward with good communication from Vickie. Would happily stay here again."
2018-11-01T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Chau,"Excellent location, walking distance to the Opera house, plenty of restaurants around. The Airbnb unit is very nice, clean and comfortable for 2 in a very secure apartment building"
2018-11-06T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Brittany,Great place to stay if you plan on staying a night or two. A little farther than I expected to the opera house. Had to Uber
2018-11-11T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Rebecca,Great place to stay at!
2018-11-13T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Schmitt,"This was a wonderful stay; the location could not be more convenient and trendy. Vicki provided excellent local recommendations, which was helpful due to the sheer volume of cafes and restaurants within walking distance. The room was comfortable and clean, and Vicki went well above and beyond to save me when I'd locked important personal items inside the room after checkout (I don't want every guest taking advantage of her emergency hospitality, but I can't thank her enough)!"
2018-11-17T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Charlie,"A great apartment ideal location, very clean and everything perfect"

2018-11-26T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Tim,"This is a perfect place to explore Sydney from, and Vickie is an excellent host!"
2018-12-03T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Mark,Couldn’t be a better location. There’s a food store across the street to stock up and you could spend a month just exploring in walking distance.  The laundry down the hall was very nice to have or you can use a laundry mat across the street.  I’d seek out this very spot if I return to Sydney.
2018-12-08T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Steven,"I did not have the opportunity to meet Vickie, but everything was clearly and quickly communicated. The apartment is beautifully and functionally decorated, with everything present you could need. The internet is fast and reliable, the kitchen well-equipped. I slept very well in the bed, with a choice of pillow hardness. The place is perfectly located, not far from restaurants, and a very lovely 30' stroll through the impressive botanical gardens to the Opera House. Highly recommended place to stay!"
2018-12-10T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Ulli,"Great location with choices for everything you might need (cafes, restaurants, supermarket, transport (bus, rail to CBD), within easy reach.  For walkers, wending your way down to Woolloomooloo, Mrs Macquarie's Chair & Botanical Gardens is a treat.  Vickie's city pad is a comfortable, tidy, pleasant retreat with a lovely view.  The immediate surroundings are excellent, as is the building in which the apartment is situated."
2018-12-19T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Moritz,Our stay in Sydney in Victoria's apartment was great. It is nicely and conveniently located in the beautiful Elizabeth Bay area. Public transport can be reached easily and even a walk to the Opera House is easily possible. The apartment is small but equipped with everything that two people need. Even breakfast and coffee was there. We would stay here again!
2018-12-22T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Linda,Perfect base for exploring the city and very well equipped.
2018-12-26T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Mickie,"The actual unit is in a great location and we enjoyed the walk to the Royal Botanical gardens and Sydney Opera House.  There is also a nice coffee spot down the street.  Unfortunately, in the listing, it says there is free street parking and we could not find any free street parking.  Upon arrival I called the host about the free street parking and she said there was not any.  We would have to park in the paid garage next to the premises, which would be $30-40 per night.  Or drive into another neighborhood (not close) to maybe find street parking.  We were staying 3 nights so that could be up to $90.  I would have figured out a different place or other parking arrangements if I knew ahead of time.  Later she messaged and said that the free street parking is limited by time.  I feel that is quite unfair to say free street parking if it is only for 1 hour or so.  So if you are traveling with a car, this is something to consider."
2019-01-03T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Thomas,"Victoria's studio apartment is a compact space that is thoughtfully outfitted. The location is great with plenty of amenities within easy walking distance and an easy bus connection to the CBD. Simple meals can be cooked in the kitchen on the hot plate and microwave, however even that can be tricky as there is no extra counter space to do prep or hold hot items other than on the hot plate. Victoria was very accommodating and attentive in her communications."
2019-01-13T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Jack,"Amazing location, nice cozy apartment !"
2019-01-19T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Julia,"good location, nice & clean apartment plus if you need anything Victoria is super fast in answering, would stay here again :)"

2019-01-29T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Hannah,A fab apartment in a great location. The view from the big window is lovely and great for people watching. The cafe at Elizabeth Bay Marina is a must for breakfast. Victoria was a great host.

Will definitely stay again. My parents thought the place was beautiful and were so excited they kept sending me photos of their stay! Well done Victoria! Thank you so much.
2019-02-18T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,David,Well located and comfortable place. Generous host. Clear communication. Comfortable bed and pillows. Great shower. All good! Highly recommended.
2019-02-23T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Suzanne,"Fabulous location with wonderful restaurants in walking distance.    It was also an easy walk into the city taking only about 20 minutes.  In addition, the hop on hop off bus picks up just down the street.   Victoria provided excellent communication throughout our booking process as well as the check in process."
2019-02-25T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Christina,Compact and well located. A great place for a short stay in Sydney.
2019-03-03T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,YeiJean,Victoria’s place was spacious enough for two people and very clean studio. Its location was pretty good. She helped me and responded very quickly whenever I needed her. There is public coin washing machine and dryer on the same floor ($3 each) Everything was quite pleasant and safe.
2013-09-09T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Annalise,"The apartment exceeded expectations.  First, the location was incredible.  Literally overlooking the Tamarama beach and a beautifull balcany to sit on and watch the world go by.  Secondly, the apartment itself was perfect.  It is clean, with great entertaining spaces and very welcoming.  You don't feel like your invading another persons home but it still feels homely - if that makes sense!  The beds, couch and linen were all clean, fresh and comfortable.Third, it's only a 10 min walk to Bondi!Finally, Wayne is lovely and immediately responded to all my questions.  We only booked the apartment a few days before, and it was my first time dealing with airbnb, so we really appreciated the quick responses.  Also, we had a bottle of champagne and chocolates on arrival which was a lovely surprise!I would highly recommend this apartment.  It is the perfect place for people who want to hang out, relax and and enjoy one of Sydney's premier beach locations.  I will definitely go back if I need a place in Sydney. "
2013-09-24T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Jacinta,"We had a great stay at Wayne and Kate's place. We travelled to Sydney for a family long weekend and from the moment we opened the door we felt at home. Their home is open and airy with a fantastic view of the beach. The location is perfect, we went on walks along the ""ocean walk"" to Bondi and the opposite direction to Coogee and Bronte. It was great sitting on the balcony looking out at the beach and the many energetic people pounding the pavements and in the water enjoying the waves. Wayne and Kate were great hosts emailing and messaging us with directions to their home and suggestions of places to visit. Nothing was too much trouble. The champagne and chocolate they left for us was also well received . We can not wait to return. Thankyou Wayne and Kate for sharing your beautiful home with us."
2013-10-04T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Shelli,"Wayne and Kate were wonderful to deal with, quick responses in the lead-up to our stay and comprehensive instructions on how to get the key when we arrived. As soon as we walked in we knew we were in for a lovely stay. The view is magnificent and the apartment is spacious and airy, and well-represented in the photos on the website. The kids loved the big TV which meant more time on the deck for us! Great walks and easy parking which is not easy to come by in Sydney. Would thoroughly recommend this place."
2013-10-07T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Eleanor,"Holy moly what an apartment. Actually better than the photos! The vibe is clean, open, breezy, sophisticated. After a picnic lunch at Bronte, We enjoyed dinner together at the table and an evening swim. We were a party of 6, and all of us slept comfortably and felt like a million dollars the entire time. The kitchen was awesome to cook in and the balcony a peaceful breakfast spot. It could not have been more perfect. "
2013-10-08T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Jason,"Everything went smoothly and Wayne and Kate were very easy to deal with. The apartment is stunning, wonderful views of the beach, and although I only spent the afternoon there, my Mum and her friends who stayed over found everything they needed and were raving about the location. I'll be back! :)"
2013-10-16T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Micae,"We had an absolutely wonderful time staying at Wayne and Kate's place.. you cannot beat waking up to the sounds of the ocean! We had friends travelling from overseas for our wedding, and we could not have asked for a better place to stay; 2-10 mins walk to any of Sydney's great beaches, and all the anemities that you need in an apartment to make the place as comfortable as possible. Wayne and Kate were fantastic in getting back to us on any inquiries and were very thoughtful and approachable. The perfect hosts! now we need another excuse to rent out the place again ;) Thanks for everything! "
2013-10-21T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Natalie,"We had a great time staying at Wayne and Kate's place. It is an absolutely beautiful apartment in an amazing spot. It was great to fall asleep listening to the sea.Me and 5 girlfriends stayed for a weekend and we were all blown away. The apartment had everything we needed, we just added a few bottles of champers to sip on the balcony and soak up the Tamarama atmosphere. Thanks Wayne and Kate :)"
2013-10-29T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Jessica,"From the first contact with Wayne and Kate my first experience using AirBNB has been fabulous! Their regular and thoughtful communication was perfect and we were so excited to stay at their beautiful apartment overlooking Tamarama Beach. We arrived to find cold bubbles in the fridge, a block of chocolate and a 'house and area manual' to assist use with everything we needed to know during our stay. The apartment was perfect! Great size for a larger group and it was so nice to have the home comforts right at our fingertips. I cannot recommend this experience enough and look forward to staying at Wayne and Kate's apartment again in the near future! "
2013-11-07T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Sandy,"We had a wonderful stay at Wayne and Kate's Tamarama apartment. Excellent communication and experience from the very start. Checking in was simple and we arrived to a lovely bottle of bubbles! The view and location are absolutely unbeatable, and the apartment is terrific. The photos do not do justice - it's an amazing apartment! Great lighting, very comfortable, and well furnished. The flat has all the amenities you need and truly makes you feel at home.  We had a very small issue with the internet dropping out periodically but Kate went above and beyond to ensure things were fixed.  And… left us another bottle of bubbles for our troubles, which was so incredibly nice!The apartment was a short walk to Bondi, Bronte and Coogee beaches.  The walk from Tamarama to Bondi is breathtaking.  We were lucky enough to catch the Sculptures by the Sea the week of our stay.Our experience was outstanding and highly recommend Wayne and Kate’s place. We did not want to leave! We look forward to staying at Wayne and Kate’s in the future. Thanks again for everything, Wayne and Kate!  :)"
2013-11-19T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Andre,"Fantastic spot although the weather was not on our side!I arrived late on the weekend, so Wayne and Kate were super accommodating with my friend John. Place is very secure, has an amazing outlook over the beach. Café’s and restaurants are a short walk away, and transport easily accessible. Great experience and would love to stay there again!"
2013-11-26T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Sarah,"Thanks Wayne and Kate we had a lovely time at your apartment. Was clean, beds comfy and great view of the beach!!"
2013-12-16T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Heather,"What an absolutely fantastic apartment and view! The hosts were fantastic to deal with and gave quick and very helpful replies! The apartment had everything we could need for a girly weekend away. Thanks so much, we all had a ball =)"
2014-01-08T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Michael,"Wayne and Kate's apartment is in a fabulous location right on the beach of Tamarama. It is clean, well maintained and suited our needs with 2 teenage boys. Thumbs up!"
2014-01-13T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Boiana,"We had a great time, the apartment was lovely, clean, the views were spectacular and all expectations from the posting were met! They even left us bubbly!The owners were very kind and even left us tips for the area.I recommend this apartment and experience highly.-Boyana"
2014-03-11T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Rori,"Absolutely perfect place to stay in Sydney! The beach is quite literally, across the road! The views are to die for day and night. Short and beautiful walk to Bondi or Bronte for restaurants, bars and bigger beaches if you want them. The apartment is clean and very comfortable,  it has everything and more you could want. And the hosts are extremely kind and accommodating. We had a ball staying here! "
2014-03-16T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Andrew,"Wayne and Kate’s beachfront apartment is simply amazing. From the moment we made an inquiry about the place, Wayne and Kate went above and beyond when responding to our questions and requests regarding the place – even replying within minutes when we sent a message at midnight!Stepping foot into the place, you might have to take a second to realise that you’re not actually in a designer home magazine. All of the amenities are in great condition and all three of the bedrooms were large with the beds comfortable and extremely clean.After settling in and making a cup of tea and coffee with the stocked kitchen, we decided to take a look at the lengthy list of activities that Wayne and Kate had compiled just for us. You can never undervalue local knowledge!While Wayne and Kate’s place is extremely fun, it’s also the perfect place to get some work done. We popped down to Tamarama Beach Café (across the road!) and bought back some coffee and sat and worked at the breakfast bar overlooking Tamarama Beach with our laptops – using the speedy wifi that was provided, of course.Simply, Wayne and Kate are amazing hosts and their stunning apartment is perfect for work, play and everything in between!"
2014-03-24T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Tiiram,"We loved staying at Wayne and Kate's beautiful apartment right on the beach. The apartment is beautifully furnished and we felt right at home. Wayne and Kate were fantastic hosts and were in regular contact to make us feel welcome. We can't stress enough how good the location is, being able to walk across the road for a swim at a moments notice is amazing. Highly recommended!"
2014-04-10T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Caroline,"Beautiful location, nice hosts, close to Bondi and Bronte for cafés and restaurants. We had a great time! Thanks Kate and Wayne. "
2014-04-22T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Julia,Wonderful apartment and extremely responsive hosts. Wish I were back on the beach!
2014-04-27T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Jacqui,"Fantastic apartment, fantastic location, fantastic hosts! Everything was thought of for us and we had a wonderful stay. The best equipped apartment we have ever stayed in...enough of everything, and more! thanks guys!  xx"
2014-05-05T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Anthony,Hi Wayne & Kate. We had three couples staying at the apartment for the weekend attending a wedding nearby.  We had a great time in the apartment and enjoyed the generous living space that you don't get in a hotel room. The view of the beach was awesome. Thanks for leaving everything so clean and tidy.I'll definitely be backcheersTony & Stef James
2014-05-12T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Oliver,"Had a fantastic weekend in this beautiful beach front apartment, hosts were great and helpful and the apartment was just as pictured if not better.I would definitely recommend staying here to anyone who loves the beach and an apartment that has everything you would need."
2014-06-02T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Steve,"We stayed here with my parents and our family for our holiday in Australia.  Location was absolutely fabulous - so close to the beach and in the middle of the beach walk so we could do our morning walks either south to Bronte/Clovelley or north to Bondi.  Once we figured out the bus system, it was easy to get back and forth to downtown Sydney from here.  The apartment was spacious, comfortable and we enjoyed our meals on the large balcony looking at the beautiful ocean and coastline.  Had a great time in Sydney - our visit coincided with Vivid Live which was amazing.  Wayne and Kate are awesome hosts - loved the champagne and would highly recommend this place for a family holiday.  House has everything you need."
2014-07-08T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Charles,I did not meet Kate and Wayne but all the arrangements to access their apartment and when leaving worked smoothly.  They responded to all notes and met all requests. The apartment is in a beautiful spot with direct access to the beach and a view from the balcony to die for.  All round a very enjoyable experience.  Thanks.
2014-08-03T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Rhys,"Absolutely fantastic place. Location is breath taking& the view is mind blowing.Would highly recommend this place and many thanks to the hosts for their quick, kind response..We had a gr8 time & look fwd to returning some time soon.Thanx again"
2014-08-09T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Catherine,Apartment is in a fantastic location with beautiful views. We loved the coastal walk and were lucky enough to see whales. The kitchen is very well equipped. The apartment worked well for an adult group but would also suit a young family. Parking was not a problem in winter. Public transport to city is very easy. Wayne and Kate were very welcoming hosts.
2014-08-12T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Nadia,Kate and Waybe were extremely accommodating and very responsive to my emails. The location is excellent literally the road between you and the beach. A lovely beach stay that I would highly recommend to others.
2014-08-17T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Loic,L'appartment est tres bien situe a Tamarama. La chambre principale est spacieuse avec baie vitree. L'interieur de l'appartement est spacieux et clair.
2014-09-01T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Virginia,Wayne and Kate were very welcoming.  We didn't select the best day as it was very rainy but it was nice to get away.
2014-09-15T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Louise,"We had a great stay at Wayne and Kate's beachfront apartment. The location is incredible. You just have to step outside the front door, cross the road and you are at a beautiful beach. A short walk along the beautiful Australian coast brings you to Bondi where there are lots of cafes, restaurants and shops. The apartment is warm and welcoming with modern and bright decorations. It was also clean and had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable. It was lovely going to sleep with the sounds of the waves crashing. Plus, Wayne and Kate donate money to the Tamarama SLSC on behalf of the guests which is a really nice and important gesture. As an added bonus, Wayne and Kate gave us a surprise late check out so we could enjoy the area a little bit longer. I would definitely stay again. "
2014-09-23T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Dylan,"Out-of-towners and Sydney residents alike loved this apartment and its location. I don't think anyone took their eyes off the ocean. We even had a whale watching session one afternoon, counting about 4 or 5 humpbacks making their way back down the coast for summer.It's an easy walk to Bronte and Bondi, but with Tamarama beach right out front you don't feel like you're missing out on anything. I was coping with some jetlag, but the others were keen to explore. The apartment proved to be a valuable centre point as people did what they wished and then met up again.The apartment itself is clean and well appointed. Definitely somewhere I'd like to spend a lot more time. We had a family gathering for my 30th birthday one night and hired a chef. He was able to deliver a number of courses from the kitchen without any worry.We were a little worried about finding parking, but I don't think we ever failed to find a spot out front."
2014-10-10T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Tao,We had a lovely two days staying at Wayne and Kates' place. Wayne was both helpful and welcoming throughout the entire experience. A lovely apartment in a truly stunning location!
2014-10-21T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Sophie,"Wayne and Kate's apartment is in an amazing position across from Tamarama Beach. It's spacious, clean, airy and peaceful, it was the perfect getaway for my dads 70th. Their instructions were clear and everything was perfect. Thanks so much for making our dad's bday a great one. He had a blast. "
2014-10-27T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Catherine,"Wonderful location, it could not have been more perfect.  Great apartment, light, clean, well appointed, homely.  It was a group of adult friends that stayed and we were very comfortable.  Hosts were very responsive  and friendly.   Great experience."
2014-11-29T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Helena,We had a fantastic time! The house is ideally located and very spacious to accomodate the group.Thanks so much :) 
2014-12-19T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Catherine,"Accurate description of property and located in a wonderful area - directly opposite an iconic beach! Great welcome pack with clear instructions on utilities. No problems with local parking. Easy access to beach and local shops. Great location for runners, surfers and sun bathers alike! Our boys wanted to move in!!Highly recommended and may consider a return in the near future!! Loved it!"
2015-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Alison,What a lovely welcoming apartment Great location overlooking the beachChampagne on arrival and lovely touches like coffee machine were an added bonusLoved going to sleep hearing the roar of the ocean and enjoying the sea breezeWould definately stay again
2015-01-27T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Christine,"Beautiful view. The apartment is spacious and right next to the beach.  But I'm confused why we received the keys in a coded box when it seems the hosts were staying close enough to the apartment to watch us and count how many people we had entering the apartment. We had a lunchtime BBQ with family from the city and were trying to take advantage of a beautiful spot but were interrupted on two occasions by the hosts driving to the apartment to tell our friends and family to leave the premises. We had no intention of breaching the six sleeper agreement and can't understand why a group of up to 15 people having a BBQ in the middle of the day is inappropriate or warrants the hosts' interruptions . If the hosts intended on being so strict with the number of people visiting, it would have made more sense for them to have advised us of their concerns when handing over the keys."
2015-02-19T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Pierre,"We spent a week in Tamarama and it was wonderful ! The appartment is really nice and ideally located with a stunning view on the ocean. It was so good to wake up in the morning and to hear the swell ! On top of that,  Wayne's organization has been perfect and everything worked well.  If we return to Sydney one day, which I hope, we'll definitely come back to Wayne and Kate's place !Thanks so muchPierre"
2015-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Eoin,"I went to Sydney on a business trip and decided I wanted to get a taste of the coast rather than city. Best decision I ever made. The property is right on Tamarama beach, walking distance from Bondi and Bronte and 20 mins from the city center. The property itself was immaculate and very tasteful. Highly recommend. "
2015-03-03T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Prue,"Wayne and Kate are the most amazing hosts - from the moment we booked with them until we left, our experience was outstanding.  The apartment is wonderfully spacious, clean and well equipped and has the most stunning views of Tamarama.  We found it very difficult to tear ourselves away from the balcony and the beach to explore other areas!  The local tips they gave us for food and coffee were spot on.  Highly recommended!"
2015-03-16T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Daniel,"Awesome location, awesome host. Cannot fault this listing, simply a wonderful experience and a delight dealing with Wayne and Kate."
2015-03-23T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Tina,"We found the hosts, Wayne & Kate very accommodating.  They were always very quick to respond to our queries and the unit was as described.  Very good position, spacious and comfortable.  The extra touch of a bottle of champagne was a very thoughtful gesture.  Street parking was not a problem.  There is a cafe directly opposite on Tamarama Beach or a short walk through the park to a strip of cafes at Bronte Beach.  Also a nice 15 min walk around the coast to Bondi.  "
2015-03-28T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Daniel,"Simply amazing hosts. Every question was attentive and every request was accommodated. Cannot speak more highly of Wayne and Kate. We would rent from Wayne and Kate again in a heartbeat and would host them anytime, simply a delight to deal with. High quality, top shelf people. Cheers Wayne and Kate!"
2015-04-04T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,John,Wonderful location right on the beach.  Spectacular views from front balcony and study.  Bottle of champagne on arrival a lovely touch from Wayne and Kate to make us feel welcome.
2015-04-07T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Matthieu,"Appartement fonctionnel pour une famille ou entre amis, terrasse donnant directement sur la plage. Même s'il est loin, Wayne vous aide  si vous avez des questions ...."
2015-04-28T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Erin,"Wayne and Kate are wonderful hosts and extremely welcoming from the very beginning!  Place was immaculate and wine and chocolates were waiting on our arrival.  Our holiday started off perfectly!  Then Mother Nature showed up.  Unfortunately, we happened to visit Sydney during ""the wettest April in 26 years"" according to news reports.  Winds were howling and there was even a hail storm.  Exciting, but not what anyone wants of plans for on vacation.  And nothing anyone could control.  Wayne and Kate went out of their way to make sure we were safe and comfortable.  They checked in on us several times.  Made sure we had food (there were weather advisories, trees were down, Uber was overwhelmed, and we didn't have a car).  Loaned us their rain gear.  Even dropped off pastries.  No one could have predicted such wild weather conditions.  But we were determined to see Sydney and they were determined to make sure we were comfortable, dry, and safe.  Wayne and Kate went above and beyond to help make our holiday a resounding success even in the midst of a wild storm.  Their spot in Tamarama is iddlic!  They have thought of everything.  Kitchen was well equipped and there was lots of reading available for those rainy days.  The views are more amazing in person.  The storm was fascinating to watch and the little beach cafe/park across the street is delightful.  Their apartment is on the coastal walk from Bondi to Coogee - loved this walk!  Fairly easy walk to Bondi (maybe not for a 3 year old or the elderly, but for most adults).  As stated, weather can't be controlled of predicted.  But these two really went all out for us.  Their care and concern help make our trip so much more enjoyable.  I feel like we not only had a great vacation, but we made some friends.I would definitely recommend this apartment and these hosts!"
2015-05-02T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Vesa,"The location is absolutely perfect!Other great things about this place:> The shower had excellent water pressure> The views were outstanding, we especially enjoyed watching the surfers and waves while eating breakfast in the study nook.> The location was perfect for easy access to the beach and to coastal morning runs. > The kitchen was well stocked with all the equipment one needed.> The bed was very comfortable, and we enjoyed waking up to the sound of waves."
2015-05-05T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Skye,"After my original accommodation was cancelled 2 days prior to my wedding I urgently needed to find alternate accommodation for my bridal party.Wayne and Kate made this possible.Their apartment is clean, tidy and has all of those little bits and pieces that you need for a nice weekend away.Thanks again guys!"
2015-05-25T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Andy,"Had a fantastiic stay at Wayne and Kate's place. We arrived on Friday night in windy and rainy conditions, but were soon cosy in the apartment with the girls snuggled in the provided blankets, and with the heaters on!Everything that we needed was provided for and the hosts quickly answered a couple of texts I sent with questions about the apartment. Waking up to blue skies and the sight of the ocean on the Saturday morning was awesome. Would love to come back and experience the place is summer! Thanks to the hosts "
2015-06-02T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Deidre,We had a wonderful 'Girls' Weekend' at Tamarama. Our hosts were most helpful emailing us lots of local information and recommendations. The apartment is in a superb position overlooking the famous Tamarama beach. We were able to watch from the balcony as locals played beach volleyball or walk down to the beach kiosk for a coffee and watch the passing whales!  Just cross the road and you are on the Bondi to Coogee walking path - great walk to Coogee and back.  The apartment is cosy and accommodates six people easily. The sound of the surf will lull you to sleep.
2015-06-11T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Q,"Wayne and Kate's apartment is a wonderful getaway - the view is breathtaking, the area is peaceful, and the decor of the apartment is charming yet practical. We travelled as a group of 4 girls and found the space very sufficient. The layout of the home is also very convenient for travelling as a group of friends as we all had enough personal space! Wayne and Kate also provide a great set of speakers and very thoughtfully included an iphone4-to-iphone6 converter! Everything was clean and ready for us when we arrived, and all the amenities were great. On top of that, Wayne and Kate were very responsive whenever we needed help with preparing for our trip, checking in to the apartment, and figuring things out in the apartment. We were trying to figure out the dryer quite late one night, and got really stuck, but Wayne and Kate were able to reply to our message immediately - we really really appreciated how quick they were with messaging! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend the apartment for sure. "
2015-06-15T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Sam,"Very nice apartment, was right next to the beach just like the picture shows.  Bus stop nearby and the UBER service us widely used in Australia for private car service. We loved the apartment, traveled with 2 adults and 4 kids.  Wife wanted to take the bedding home because it was so comfortable! We just came off a 18 day cruise so we had a ton of laundry there was a dry cleaner that did it for $50 AUD nearby or you can do it in the apartment with the washer and dryer provided but we had too much.The host was very involved prior and during our stay, they asked us what our interests were prior to coming and gave us some recommendations.  While there they checked on us several times to be sure things were working to our satisfaction and even offered to pickup our laundry and take them to the dry cleaners because we had too much for their unit to handle.  We also accidentally left a iPad there any they are being very helpful in getting it back to us, all we have to do is pay the cost of the until and they are packing it up and taking it to the local DHL office..Very nice experience! Thanks!"
2015-06-30T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Sandy,All of our queries prior to arrival were happily replied to very promptly. Wayne and Kate emailed us a list of attractions / activities that may have interested us during our stay. On arrival we were presented with a nice bottle of champagne which we certainly appreciated.
2015-07-20T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Daniel,"Wayne and Kate are amazing hosts. Their enthusiasm, genuine care and willingness to go above and beyond was very much appreciated. If you are looking for an authentic Sydney experience, this is it! Would definitely recommend their beachfront home to anyone."
2015-07-27T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Chiko,"outside of building is rather old and worried bit but description is accurate and interior is beautifully done, location is great for relaxing weekend.As I came back from overseas without sleep all night, we hadmixed up where key is.  Kate took taxi from her work to delivery the key and Wayne came to drop bottle but we got delicious croissant!for their apology.  it is very relaxing cosy place"
2015-08-03T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Rebecca,"Wayne and Kate were friendly hosts who remained easy to contact throughout our stay. The location of the apartment was fantastic - just across the road from Tamarama beach. You can hear the waves crashing on the beach as you fall asleep. We had some noisy neighbours on the Saturday night (that was obviously no fault of the hosts) but otherwise it was a very enjoyable stay. The kitchen is well equipped for cooking, and the apartment was comfortable for the 6 of us. We were lucky to have warm winter weather when we visited and thoroughly enjoyed the beach track walks to Bondi and Coogee. "
2015-08-11T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Shelley,"Wayne and Kate were great hosts from the very first inquiry. Their responses were very timely, in some cases instant, and extremely informative.Their property is ideal for a relaxed getaway and the views across Tamarama beach from the balcony, study and the main bedroom are stunning... it was very hard to leave! Great cafes and parks are within walking distance either way - around to Bondi or Bronte. Bus stops are are five minute walk and in most cases, we could jump on a bus within a few minutes that took us straight to Sydney's CBD. Inside the unit Wayne and Kate have thought of everything! We wanted for nothing and could find everything easily. The unit is light and bright and well suited for a family or a group friends.The champagne on arrival blew us away and the donation from our accommodation fee to the Tamarama Surfing Life Saving Club was so touching, that we all said we would definitely stay there again!We went to Sydney to participate in the City to Surf fun run and ended up having one of the best long weekends ever!Thanks Wayne and Kate!"
2015-08-18T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Melissa,"Wayne and Kate made us feel incredibly welcome even before we arrived. They were very helpful giving us great advice on surfboard hire and local eateries which were easily accessible in this beautiful neighbourhood. The apartment itself lived up to all our expectations. It was light-filled, clean, warm and welcoming with stunning views and provided ample space for the 6 of us (two grandparents, us and our two kids) to relax. Going to sleep with the sound of the surf was so restful and the beds really comfy. And the chocolates and sparkling were a lovely touch! Thanks Wayne and Kate. We loved our stay and would definitely return. "
2015-09-29T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Matt,"Wayne and Kate are amazing hosts, and communicated to us on a regular basis both before and during stay. The apartment is modern, clean and has a great view as per the photos of the beach. Would definitely stay here again, and the best host experience we have had since joining airbnb!"
2015-10-05T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Therese,We loved our weekend at Wayne and Kate's apartment. The view was amazing and the apartment was well presented and had everything we needed. The bottle of champagne left for us was a lovely surprise too. We would definitely stay here again.
2015-10-12T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Nicola,We had a wonderful stay and the view was most definitely the highlight. What a spectacular aspect this apartment has. Great people watching! We were lucky enough to have wonderful weather for our stay and to sit out on the gorgeous balcony and people watch whilst drinking wine and eating seafood -- well you can't get much better than that! The apartment was very spacious and the kitchen was packed with great cooking materials/utensils etc. It was a comfortable stay and we thoroughly enjoyed it.
2015-10-20T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Alysha,Wayne and Kate were wonderful hosts. The apartment was clean and as the pictures depict.  The location was phenomenal and the bottle of champagne a delightful bonus...The amount of thought that has gone into making guests welcome and having all things available was very much noted and appreciated.
2015-10-27T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Rosalind,We had a lovely stay at Kate and Wayne's place. The view couldn't be better!  The apartment is a lovely space to relax in and well equipped. Wayne and Kate were great at getting back to us really quickly. Would highly recommend.
2015-11-05T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Shuo,"Beautiful views and closed to bondi beach, very easy-going. Close to city too. "
2015-11-16T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Geraldine,"Wayne & Kate we had a wonderful stay in your apartment, the view was amazing, close to everything the unit had everything we needed, thank again we will be back Tony & Geraldine "
2015-11-27T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,TurnKey Vacation Rentals,Couldn't have been happier staying at Wayne & Kate's. It's in the perfect location - right across from a beautiful beach and a close walk to everything. We felt very welcomed and they were easily accessible to answer any questions. The walk along the beach sidewalk is worth the visit alone. Wasn't sure I'd be interested in returning to Australia again until this visit - now I'd definitely like to make it back and would be happy to stay at their place in Tamarama again. It's a beach house - not 5 star pristine hotel conditions - and we totally enjoyed it!
2015-12-05T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Carolyn,Great place to stay with fabulous views and great beaches at your doorstep
2015-12-15T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Shirley,"Wayne and Kate were so helpful,efficient and responsive from my first request. The apartment was great and in a fantastic position. Everything we needed was supplied including a bottle of champagne to welcome us - we are here for a family wedding so the best way to start. The balcony is a joy and such a social area.   If we ever have the chance would certainly book again. "
2015-12-18T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Joseph,"We stayed here with our kids and my mum and everyone had a great time.  Literally across the street from an amazing beach and park - which contained a very nice coffee shop.  Wayne & Kate were great.  Super helpful, very responsive and really great positive Aussie attitude.  I'd highly recommend this place."
2016-01-09T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Yvonne,Hosts could not have been more welcoming from the goodies to the lovely bottle of champagne which was a lovely surprise after such a long journey they were also most accommodating with the key pick up location could not have been more perfect we all loved it the perfect hosts and perfect location hopefully we will make it back sometime
2016-01-12T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Dalia,"Couldn't recommend this property more highly. Hosts were attentive, lovely and on the ball. Apartment was light, spacious even for two adults and three big boys! The absolute highlight though was the view of breathtaking Tamarama and being able to step across the road and into Sydneys' incredible beach culture. We felt like locals and will be back for sure. "

You overlook beautiful Tamarama beach, which is right between Bondi and Bronte (both within walking distance).  The decor is simple and clean and the apartment was outfitted with just the right stuff (champagne and a nespresso machine :). The hosts were very accommodating and available to help with anything you need. Highly recommend this location for a base in Sydney.  "

2016-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Silvia,"Der Kontakt zu den Gastgebern hat  sehr gut funktioniert. Wir hatten das Gefühl, dass unsere Gastgeber wirklich daran interessiert sind, dass wir einen schönen Urlaub haben und uns in der Wohnung wohlfühlen. Unsere Fragen wurden immer sofort und ausführlich beantwortet. Die Wohnung entspricht den Beschreibungen und Bildern.  Sie ist sehr komfortabel und geschmackvoll ausgestattet, so dass wir uns gleich wie zuhause gefühlt haben.   Der Balkon hat einen  tollem Blick auf den Strand, den wir gern und oft genutzt haben, da er schattig war und immer ein kleiner Wind für Erfrischung gesorgt hat. "
2016-03-08T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Phuong,"Wayne and Kate are actually the ultimate, best hosts we've ever ever had - and their place in Tama is absolutely amazing. Clean, modern, so super comfortable - and the views! We were made to feel so super welcome. We loved the fact that Wayne and Kate donate some of their proceeds to the Tama SLSC - so very important to us. Wayne and Kate respected our privacy but were also extremely hospitable if we ever needed anything - and are also really warm people. Nothing was too much of an ask, and we had such a relaxing getaway because of it. Their home was so easy to relax in, and that balcony served as our main living space for our entire stay - it was hard to resist.Wayne & Kate are such wonderful hosts, we'd jump at the chance of staying there again on our next stay, if they would have us.Thanks Wayne & Kate - you're absolute legends!"

2016-11-05T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Celina,"We had an amazing time staying at Wayne and Kate's beautiful home. The location could not have been better, if what you're wanting is Sydney beach living. While our first choice was to stay directly on Bondi, much to our surprise this Tamarama location was so much better and away from the chaos on Bondi. This three bedroom home was clean and looked exactly like the pictures. Will definitely book this place again if I ever find myself in Sydney."
2016-11-11T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Jeffrey,Best Host ever... left my electric toothbrush and they delivered it to where I was staying next in another area.. nothing but Love.

The apartment is bright, comfortable and has sweeping views of the ocean which is right outside your window. We were also really surprised at how quiet the building was at night. The apartment is in a great location close to transport, beaches and shops. Thanks Wayne and Kate we would certainly choose to stay at your Tama pad again."
2017-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Monica,Great location right on the beach. Champagne and chocolates on arrival a surprising touch. Fantastic sharp knives in the well equiped kitchen with a Nespresso and a good supply of pods to keep us caffeinated!Parking on the street only an issue during the day in the busy summer holiday period but ample spots after hours.
2017-01-03T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Michelle,"Wayne and Kate's place is amazing, bright and spacious and right beside the beautiful Tamarama beach.

2017-01-08T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Melissa,"Wayne and Kate's place is everything that we imagined. We stayed there for 5 nights and wished we could have extended our trip! First of all, Wayne and Kate are wonderful hosts. They were very responsive and was happy to answer all of our questions. They were also very accommodating and allowed us to check-in earlier and check-out later to match our flight schedules. Checking in and out was super convenient as they left us with very clear instructions. A manual regarding the apartment was also given to make navigating around the place easier. They even left us coffee and a bottle of bubbles to welcome us! Their apartment is right on Tamarama Beach (2 mins walking), and about 15-20 mins walk from Bondi Beach making it very convenient to go shopping, have a coffee or breakfast! The apartment itself was very clean, and all toilet amenities (including shampoo, conditioner, hairdryer, clean towels etc) were provided. Even though they didn't have air conditioners, they provided us with huge fans that kept us cool throughout our stay. I highly recommend their place, can't wait to visit again! "
2017-02-04T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Skye,We absolutely loved our stay - it was everything we hoped for and more! And to be just across from the beach was incredible. Thanks Wayne and Kate
2017-02-18T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Ryan,"Wayne and Kate's property in Tamarama far exceeded any expectations we had.  This was our first airbnb stay, but from just a few minutes after we made the booking, Wayne and Kate ensured this experience would be fantastic for us.The apartment is in an amazing location - literally 50m from the beach and 100m to a beautiful cafe where we enjoyed breakfast each morning.  It's just a short and picturesque walk to Bondi beach, and close to lots of great shops and restaurants.The apartment is very clean and homely.  It has three bedrooms - one with an ensuite - a nice lounge, a fully equipment kitchen, a laundary and a large balcony overlooking Tamarama Beach.The apartment had everything we needed including linen and wifi.We had six adults staying and there was more than enough room for us all, but this location would also be perfect for families of all ages.  We will be bringing our two young children back soon!!We caught a cab to from Sydney airport to Tamarama which cost about $80 each way in a Maxi Taxi.I can't recommend Wayne and Kate's apartment enough.  It's perfect for individuals, couples, families and everyone else.  I'm looking forward to coming back!!"
2017-02-26T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Abigale,Wayne and Kates place was great!!! The location was awesome and within walking distance to all the main beaches. They were extremely accommodating with all of our request and even suggested things for us to do when the weather wasn't great. We had a great time and would totally recommend them!! Thanks Wayne and Kate!
2017-03-05T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Phuong,"Kate and Wayne are the absolute best hosts! Accommodating, warm, friendly and always on hand to help whenever we needed. We've stayed at their beachfront place in Tamarama before, and didn't hesitate to stay there again. A++ Would stay again, in a heartbeat.Thanks guys!"
2017-03-11T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Nicholas,"Wayne and Kate's house was everything we'd hoped for, and a lot more. The view is simply spectacular, the house itself tastefully decorated comfortable, and the little touches that make all the difference put the icing on the cake. You must stay here if you're looking for a little hidden beach oasis in Sydney's eastern suburbs. "
2017-03-22T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Joe,Amazing views of the beach and really easy to get to other local beaches. Would definitely stay again!
2017-04-01T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Fran,"Wayne and Kates place is in a great location looking straight out onto Tamarama beach. Accomodation is good - beds comfy, good kitchen and bathroom. Would stay there again. Jeff and Fran."
2017-04-08T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Shiz,This place is in an amazing location. The beaches are at your doorstep. The hosts were very helpful and thoughtful. Definitely worth a visit!
2017-04-16T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Cass,"Great view, its all about the view. Over looking Sydney's best beach. Perfect. Transport is a little hit and miss, it always is for the bus but an Uber is only $30 each way from the apartment to the city. Easy stroll along the cliff top to Bondi and all the eating and drinking it offers. Great location for a short break in beautiful Sydney"
2017-04-29T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Nick,"Amazing space, lots of light and the best views of the beach. Wayne is a great host and we would definitely stay again. "
2017-05-05T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,William,"Hi, We really enjoy the beach view in front of the building.  I think the next tentant will definitely love the Nice home and the local life.Cheers,"
2017-05-13T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Kim,"A very lovely, tastefully and comfortably appointed apartment in a beautiful location. The view is amazing and you can hear the ocean :). It's a moderate walk to food/shops, but through a very nice area. Would happily stay again."
2017-07-08T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Cameron,"Wayne and Kate's apartment is a fantastic place to stay, in so many ways. The location is second to none...right across from the beach, good coffee nearby and bondi beach is a short stroll away. Parking looks like it might be tricky, but we never had a problem. There is one flight of stairs to walk up, but even my bad knees coped and it's worth it for the view anyway!The apartment itself is gorgeous. Beautiful views, comfy beds, a well appointed 'library',  a selection of toiletries, lovely lamps, vibrant art and everything easy to find and operate thanks to a small information leaflet, or even a quick phone call...Wayne and Kate were both readily contactable and quick to help when we got a bit stuck at check-in!The apartment is very clean...and I'm pretty fussy when it comes to accommodation cleanliness. The linen is fresh, there are towels aplenty, blankets, pillows, complete kitchen...everything you need to be comfortable. I would highly recommend this apartment for up to 6 (Website hidden by Airbnb) a gem. "
2017-07-23T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Alec,Wayne & Kate's place was a great experience. The location is great and the view from the balcony was sensational. They made it a really easy with everything set out and done for us with a whole list of things to do in the area. I highly recommend this place as I hope to be returning whenever I'm in Sydney. Very fun weekend over all. Thanks guys !
2017-08-11T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Sravan,The place is as advertised. Clean and with an absolutely beautiful view. Perfect access to our favorite beach in the area with an amazing walk/run/activity trail. Would go back in a heartbeat!!
2017-08-13T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Katrina,Wayne and Kate's place was exactly as expected. Bright and airy and with views to die for. It has everything you need for a short stay and in a great location. Only a short walk away to Bondi but if you don't fancy venturing out there's no need to. Wayne was always quick to respond to questions prior to our stay and left a very handy manual with everything you could need to know about the apartment. The Street parking can be tricky at peak times but is untimed all day which is rare so close to Bondi. A great stay!
2017-09-03T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Sue,"We booked Wayne and Kate's place in order to be close (but not too close) to our daughter's wedding venue in Bondi!  It was perfect!!! The sunroom with its amazing view was the perfect place for hair and makeup to be done.  The apartment was spacious enough to give us all plenty of room and the relaxing vibe was just what we needed to keep us calm! The sound of the ocean and comfy beds ensured a great night's sleep.  Wayne and Kate are so thoughtful and accomodating, and their communication is brilliant. We would love to return for a longer and more relaxing stay next time! Highly recommended!!"
2017-09-11T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Leonie,"The photography is misleading on two areas, they show a nice ambience inside but there are no photos of the exterior and of a building which is outdated and in need of significant repair.  The building is a serious disappointment.  Secondly the interior photography is selective in as much as it doesn't show details including aspects of disrepair.  The paint on the front door chipped and damaged, carpets are grubby and stained, the window coverings are damaged, their is rust on the internal hinges, windows fittings are corroded; laundry bench cracked,  all matters that can easily be addressed.  A major disappointment other then location.  A very positive aspect was the owners commitment to sharing the daily tariff with the local surf life saving club."
2017-10-07T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Frances,"This is the second time my family and I have stayed at Wayne and Kate's apartment in Tamarama. It really is that fabulous. A beautiful apartment to stay in, in the most fabulous location, and the most wonderful hosts you could imagine."

The beds are incredibly comfortable, we hade everything we needed and the view is to die for. Watching the ocean from the balcony was both calming and rejuvenating. The cafe on the beach opposite serves great food and coffee and our kids loved the beach and the playground. Thank you Wayne and Kate for being so attentive and thoughtful, we had a wonderful time."
2018-07-28T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Stephen,"Couldn’t rate it highly enough. Great place, great location, great hosts. It’s a ripper."

2016-09-02T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Jon,Desireé the host was very friendly and replied quickly to any questions. The apartment was a little noisy from the road outside but it wasn't a big issue. It has obviously been recently renovated and is very clean. There was tea/coffee and milk which was a convenient touch. I would recommend this Airbnb.
2016-09-11T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Hye Ryoung,"If you are looking for room with have the best location and the most comfortable room condition, Desireé's room is just what you looking for. It's exactly same as the pictures, super clean, large enough for 1 or 2 person and you need only 3 mins walk from the Museum Station. It's also close to the mart, convenience store and easy to take a taxi. What I love the most is that it's just near the Hyde Park. It means that you could walk there every morning and night with beautiful view. And comfortable bed, clean and large shower booth, big screen TV with Samsung Smart-hub, big dinning table... everything in room was ready for your perfect trip. In addition, Desireé is really kind, good-hearted host. I couldn't meet her but she always answer kindly to my messages and give help everytime :D Don't miss this room!! "
2016-09-13T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Anne,"Desirée is an excellent host. Quick to respond to questions and most helpful. The accommodation itself is spacious and exceedingly clean/tidy. The location is excellent - near to the Museum train station (direct connection to airport in only 15min) and a very pleasant 15min stroll, via Hyde Park, to Martin's place. I would definitely recommend the accommodation to both business travelers and tourists."

2016-09-22T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Janine,"My daughter and I came to Sydney for her medical school interview.  Desiree was an outstanding host - providing detailed instructions on every stage of our stay, including our last day where she kindly offered for us to check out later than the arranged time.  The apartment was immaculate and really did provide a home away from home. You could seriously just turn up at his place as everything is provided for the guest's use. Desiree thought of all the little special touches - from fresh fruit and sparkling water to chocolates and flowers.  The location is fantastic - walking distance to all that Sydney has to offer.

2016-10-23T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Alfie,"What an amazing apartment! I would highly recommend this apartment! I stayed here with my partner and we had plenty of space. It was in a perfect location right across from Hyde park. I did not use the pool but the apartment does have a roof top heated pool which looked great. Apartment was clean and the bed was comfy. Desireé was a wonderful host and had some lovely touches such as stocking the fridge with beers and provided snacks, fruit and milk etc. the bathroom was also stocked with products and didn't even need to use my own shampoo etc. We also were allowed an early check in and a late check out which was just amazing. I will be staying here again on my next visit. "
2016-11-03T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Abi,"This was a sensational experience from start to finish. Desireé was exceptionally communicative and helpful, across arrival instructions and helpful hints, to being extremely flexible with my check in and departure times from the property. She was wonderfully generous with items left in the fridge for me to help myself to, and even some lovely fresh flowers for me on arrival. It's a gorgeous apartment right in the hub of the city BUT with the bedroom double glazed I had some of the best nights sleeps here I've had in ages. Terrific stay. Best part? Uber wide screen Tv and free NETFLIX! I loved this apartment. Don't hesitate to book."
2016-11-13T05:00:00.000Z,10108388,Bobbie,Desiree certainly knows how to make her guests feel welcome. Fresh flowers and chocolates on arrival is an example. Her attention to detail was very much appreciated and one of my best airbnb experiences to date. She was also quick to respond to all queries. The apartment is as shown in the photos and immaculately clean. Dont hesitate to stay here!
2016-11-17T05:00:00.000Z,10108388,Mariano,Todo ha sido perfecto! La comodidad del apartamento es aún mejor en vivo que en las fotos. Los detalles y amabilidad de Desiree son grandiosos. Sin duda aconsejo por ubicación y comodidades este apartamento para conocer la preciosa Sydney es perfecto!

2016-12-09T05:00:00.000Z,10108388,Judith,"My parents loved Desirée's flat. She had left a hand written note and ferrero rocher as well as beautiful, fresh flowers to make it a special welcome. A perfectly stocked kitchen and tasty tea made it really homely. It was also spotless clean and the African styled furnishings gave it a memorable touch. The house has friendly reception staff and they were helpful with giving directions. The location is sublime as it overlooks Hyde Park which is really close to both parts of the city centre. We highly recommend the flat and would happily stay again in the future. Thanks!"

2017-02-06T05:00:00.000Z,10108388,Deborah,"Loved this apartment.  It is located across from beautiful Hyde Park.  You can easily walk to the botanical gardens, many museums and art galleries, the opera house and much more.  The apartment itself is beautiful, nicely furnished, has all the amenities you would want including coffee, tea, milk, cookies, fruit and more.  There is a convenience store right next to it.  Desiree could not have been warmer or more helpful. She was available any time we had a question.  We already asked to book another stay and we will recommend her place to friends."
2017-02-14T05:00:00.000Z,10108388,Marie,"This is a very nice condo, location was awesome.  We walked everywhere and went to some of the restaurants Desiree recommended, we were not disappointed.  Had a great stay and most certainly would love to do it again. "
2017-02-19T05:00:00.000Z,10108388,Mike,"The apartment was perfectly located and very lovely.  It's just as nice as the pics, and Desiree was the perfect host.  The neighborhood is wonderful, and the guidebook Desiree provided was very useful.  Definitely go to Messina at least once for gelato (we went twice).  We also loved the ARTERY gallery, and bought some nice gifts for friends back home and even a cool painting that I could carry on to the plane.  Overall a great experience and a perfect spot to end our trip to Australia in style."
2017-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,10108388,Ines,"The appartment is very confortable, very clean and new. It is like it's shown no pictures.

The location is convenient, easy to get from the airport and with lots of buses stops, in a nice area. We had a great time! "
2017-03-05T05:00:00.000Z,10108388,Arbel,"This is best place to stay in Sydney! Just few steps to the Hyde Park. Right in the central area which is easy to travel,exploring and food hunting.When we arrived this beautiful apartment. Everything you see make you feel like home. Because we were there for the Sydney gay and lesbian mardi gras. You can watch the parade at the balcony (Best view ever).And we thank you for the host making our trip in Sydney unforgettable."

2017-03-21T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Richard,"This is a lovely apartment, in a hotel/serviced apartment building.  For once the pictures really don't do it justice.  The hotel rooms get marked down for being dated in reviews on hotel sites, but this apartment certainly isn't.  It's centrally located: it has Darlinghurst's little strip of restaurants just around the corner, and central Sydney equally close in the other direction.  I was here for a week in March and it (unusually) rained every day, so the 60"" UHD Samsung smart TV with Netflix and Stan (Aussie streaming), as well as Apple TV, was particularly welcome, as was the small gym on the roof.  The pool was less useful, but would be great normally.  Desireé is a very friendly host too.  Highly recommended."
2017-03-24T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Ishara,"Desireé’s apartment is the perfect place to explore Sydney city from. Perfectly central to all city sights. The apartment was super clean and neat. It hosts beautiful city views, a quick 5 minute walk to Museum rail station, and a hop to great restaurants and nightlife. The apartment is tastefully decorated with art and books from adventurous travels; furnished and accessorized with absolutely everything that I could require, plus more. I was impressed at the Desireé's thoughtfulness in accommodating her guests needs. Such things as a kind welcome note. Petite chocolates, mini fresh milk packs in the fridge, expresso machine and every conceivable toiletry item one could need inside a bathroom cabinet. Discreetly rolled up extension cords so you never have to look for one to reach the wall socket to charge your digital devices. The bed was comfortable, where sprigs of fragrant lavender greeted us laid upon freshly rolled up towels. We loved our stay and highly recommend Desireé as a host. She communicated well, was always polite and prompt with messaging all required information upon booking. There's no doubt why Desireé has been voted as a super host. You will be delighted."
2017-04-06T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Annamarie,This is a wonderful place to stay comfortable and clean easy access and very close to Museum Station and  beautiful Hyde Park. The host is marvelous and provided us with so many wonderful amenities. We would definitely stay here again .
2017-04-15T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Corey,Desireé is a wonderful host. She's easy to contact and responds promptly when you send her an email. Her place is very comfortable and clean. She let us arrive early and we had no problem staying an extra night. We really appreciated that!! Transport to the city and surrounding areas are very close to her place. Great place to walk around lots to see and do. I would definitely stay again :)
2017-04-19T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Fay,"Lovely, tastefully designed and very clean apartment in a great location. We had high expectations having read the rave reviews and it certainly did not disappoint. "
2017-04-24T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Helen,Desiree was the perfect host.  The apartment is just as it is down on the airbnb site.  Desiree answered our many queries and requests super-quickly and she is very approachable and friendly.  The location is really close to all the CBD attractions and public transport.  Desiree added so many extras like a bottle of wine and chocolates to help us celebrate our milestone anniversary. We would highly recommend this listing. Thanks Desiree!

There is everything you could want close by, especially restaurants and public transport, the airport train is just a few meters away. The apartment has everything you could possibly need and more.

2017-07-10T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Angus,"This is a lovely apartment for a couple. Well fitted out, a few essentials for eating in and decorated with a very tasteful African theme. During the cool winter evenings, the reverse cycle heaters were fantastic. Traffic noise was well muted by the double glass in the bedroom. Desireé was very communicative through our stay and had provided lots of info about Sydney and what to do, where to eat, etc. "
2017-07-16T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Ric,"This is a little treasure in the best part of Sydney!

2017-09-02T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Graeme,"We spent a very comfortable 8 nights in Desiree's apartment.  It is just as it looks in the pictures.  It is smartly decorated with comfortable furniture and lovely modern kitchen and bathroom.  There is a guest laundry in the building with coin operated machines and you can do a big wash and dry for $4 each.  The apartment is bright and airy and has a nice busy city outlook which we enjoyed.  You can certainly hear the buzz of the city around you but you are right in the CBD so that is to be expected and enjoyed.  The location is fantastic.  You can walk to just about everything in the city centre and trains and buses are only metres away if you want to get around more quickly or go further afield.  Very easy access from the airport by train into Museum station. The host, Desiree, was a pleasure to deal with, excellent communication all the way through.  This is a wonderful little home away from home putting you right into centre of the Sydney action."
2017-09-11T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Mario,Eine sehr Zentrum nah gelegene Wohnung. Absolut empfehlenswert um Sydney zu entdecken. Man kann optimal zu Fuß in die Innenstadt und läuft nur kurz durch den Hyde Park. Zum Flughafen sind es auch nur 15 Minuten.

It continued with an immaculate unit that provided us an oasis from our sight seeing. We use Airbnb quite a bit and especially enjoy being able to have a kitchen area for a quick breakfast or meal and morning coffee. The unit was close to grocery, public transport and amenities were as if I had lived there. We were there to celebrate my spouse's 50th birthday and were pleasantly surprised by the nice and thoughtful birthday card. Thank you again and we had a blast!"

We took the bus to Coogee and Bondi beaches, to Sydney Fish Market, to Opera House and ferry hub of Circular Quay for the ferry to Manly.  You are also on subway routes too!The home is quiet even though the street and park are well used.  It feels super safe to walk in.There are great grocery and restaurant options right here...and we were hooked on Greenhouse Coffee just a few blocks down to start our day.

I came for the Sydney Film Festival, and the apartment was well located on Hyde Par, so I could walk to and from the venue. The studio was very comfortable and well stocked too - the little things such as tea, milk, spreads for breakfast etc were thoughtful. Picking up and dropping off the keys were a breeze and whilst I did not meet my host, she was very responsive and helpful. I can highly recommend this place for a city based jaunt. Thanks again Desiree"

The double glazing in the bedroom and super comfy bed meant we slept like a log, and the rest of the apartment is stylish and very comfortable. As per previous reviews, Desiree's thoughtful touches, excellent communication and brilliant local recommendations really shines and elevates the whole experience to something very special. We stayed with our toddler, and the building/apartment has excellent pram accessibility. "

It was very central to everything we wanted to do in Sydney. She also left us chocolate, coffee, milk and other food for us which was so lovely to come to. We traveled very far and were immediately impressed by the lovely accommodation and personal touch of Desiree’s flat. I would highly recommend this apartment if coming to Sydney for a city break!"

Apartment was very clean and comfortable for our stay. Desireé was very prompt in any communication before and during our stay. Highly recommend.
2019-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,10108388,Matthew,"This AirBnB is not to be missed! Home was very clean and there were thoughtful touches upon check in. I arrived very late at night and the check in process was quick and easy. The host had amazing and quick responses during my stay - great communication. The apartment has 2 balconies which allow loads of sunlight into the space when the curtains are pulled back. Great location for Ubers, Taxis, walks in the park. I stayed for business and I walked to the CBD within 15 minutes - easy. I will definitely stay again!"
2019-02-06T05:00:00.000Z,10108388,Dave,"The moment you enter this Airbnb you realize this is a host who cares.  Chocolate on the coffee table, cold water in the fridge, cereal on the shelf, and roses in the bedroom greeted us.  Nine floors up you can hear the street noise but the bedroom is surprisingly quiet.  The location is near the metro and walkable to the waterfront.  This home and its location were perfect for our 6 night stay.  Would happily return on our next trip to Sydney."
2019-02-22T05:00:00.000Z,10108388,Joyce,"This city sized apartment was wonderful.   Very clean, well stocked with most everything you need.   Located around grocery stores, pharmacies, shops, restaurants and bars.  Great location for exploring Sydney,  buses and trains within 5 minutes, walking distance to circular quay. Street noise was remarkably low in the bedroom. The only shortcoming was the internet connection,  very spotty if more than one device was was connected.   We would definitely stay here upon our return to Darlinghurst."
2019-03-06T05:00:00.000Z,10108388,Joe,"I highly recommend Desiree's place to anyone visiting Sydney.  It's convenient, clean, and very comfortable.  Desiree was an outstanding host.  She was communicative, helpful, and went above and beyond.  I hope to return."
